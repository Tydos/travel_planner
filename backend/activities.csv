I\'d originally planned to go to one of the newer spots but I\'ve been here many times and knew they wouldn\'t disappoint me. I wish the rest of the city was like Chinatown that place is always jumping it feels like NYC. \n\nService 4.5/5\nThe counter lady was all business but the two people in front of me were elderly and I thought she could have been a little gentler with their cake box. I\'d a feeling there was an actual cake inside and the man commented to me that ""this is a peaceful place,"" right before she slammed his cake box on the counter. Now he epitomized customer loyalty but I could see (though he didn\'t say it) he didn\'t feel appreciated by the counter lady. A loyal customer is special and should be treated accordingly. \n\nAmbiance 3/5\nI\'ve been here before it\'s not peaceful. But I enjoyed the people watching. There are usually senior citizens sitting together watching the news in Chinese with a cup of coffee or tea it\'s lovely to see them. And even better b/c the scent of coffee wafting through the cafe/bakery smelled divine. I didn\'t order it though b/c I\'m a habitual insomniac so no caffeine for me after 2pm.\n\nFood\nEgg tart 3/5\nThough it was delicious it was way too sweet for me and i love sweets. The tart crust was perfect but the egg custard was too sweet. I won\'t order it again although it was very creamy and otherwise cooked perfectly.\n\nRainbow cake 5/5\nNot too sweet - it was perfect and just the right amount of frosting. The sponge cake was moist and had the right texture. I basically have the pallet of a little kid so if i see rainbow sprinkles i say yes please.\n\nMy check came to $2 so I highly recommend you make a visit and try different items b/c at those prices you can afford to take some risks !', 'Impression: The good thing is that there are like 5-6 of these kinds of Asian Chinese bakeries around Chinatown- Mong Kok is another one that sells the same get up: sesame balls, roll cakes, taro buns, egg tarts, meat buns, ham and cheese breads- your typical Hong Kong South East Asian kinds of bakeries that sell their fares for less than 1$ each. The bad thing is, b/c it is the same as the rest, it may be hard to find something you\'ve never tried before- but their cheese cakes looked to be their stand apart from other bakeries. This is the only ""Asian"" bakery on this street across from Nine Ting, the new Taiwanese popcorn chicken, right by Red King BBQ, and Wong Wong Restaurant. It\'s a solid Chinese bakery- neither fancy nor cheap and poor quality, neither special or bland but solid if you\'re looking for the typical Chinese desserts and pastries \n\nBecause it\'s cheap, feel free to load up on a large stash of goodies! Egg tarts were 0.80$, sesame balls were also 0.80$ and the green tea roll cake was only 3.50$. I like to take these treats home and eat them slowly over the next few days. The sesame balls and the tarts taste great if you stick them in the microwave and zap it for 30 seconds to 1 min. Pair it with some good tea and you got yourself a nice afternoon tea for your studies/work/friends', ""The pastries are decent but the coconut bread and raisin breads are very dough-y and had the tendency to stick to the roof of your mouth.  The coconut bread only had a very scant amount of shredded coconut and was, itself, a bit on the bland side.  Definitely not even close to what you would get in Flushing.  We had to toast the bread just so we could actually swallow i The sesame butter cookies were fantastic: light, crisp, covered in sesame seeds, and containing the perfect amount of sweetness.  These are much akin to the butter cookies from Roma's and Isgro's, except with an Asian twist, compliments of the sesame seeds.  The almond puffs are also quite delish and very flaky and light with plenty of sliced, toasted almonds and a drizzle of honey on top.  The egg tarts are great with a flakey, layered, and buttery crust.  Come here for the cookies, egg tarts, and pastries, not for the breads.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0

Their happy hour deals include wines, one of their signature cocktails (I believe it was a whiskey cocktail on the day that we went) and a select few bites. Although we passed on their drink specials, we did order their $6 dumplings and a spicy salmon roll. As for drinks, we both ordered off of the cocktail list. She got the Shiso Picate which comes with mezcal and jalapeño and I got the Winston's Heat with gin, wasabi and cucumber. We both loved our drinks - so much so that we were happy to get a second round!\n\nAside from the happy hour food that we got, we also ordered the fried Brussels sprouts, Tuna Tartare, and the Fishtown roll. The Brussels sprouts came in a fairly large bowl and were fantastic. I'm a huge fan of Brussels sprouts and and these were some of the best I've had in Philly - and trust me I've had my fair share! The tuna was a choice my friend made and it was also very good. Lastly the roll we got was so delicious and very filling!

California, California with real crab made crispy, cucumber roll, peanut avocado (the kids' favorite!), seaweed salad, edamame, and incredible Brussels! Must order!

It will be be on my radar for the next First Friday or after a movie at The Ritz!\n\nI actually found it a tad difficult to spot from the street. It's the door just to the left of United Blue. Not a huge sign. It's there, trust me :) \n\n*Limited kiosk meter parking."", ""Tuna Bar is an awesome new addition to the Old City neighborhood! \n\nThe decor at this place rocks - the space is bright and airy and inviting.

We had a tasty gin cocktail with orange. \n\nThe food was all pretty good. The seaweed salad was decent, can't say it was particularly standout. The sushi was all tasty- fresh and presented beautifully. The crispy fried shrimp bites with tuna and caviar on top were my favorite dish - YUM.

But after I called back I was told that he would be there within the hour, and everything went uphill from then on. Shay was courteous and professional and disarmed the alarm system and made a transponder key for me in no time. The key cost $145 (so it's definitely more than what the previous reviewer paid for but I think it also depends on the car; I think $145 is still reasonable for a transponder key though); all in all I got me a new key and a drivable car for $225 so I think that was pretty decent. I am satisfied with the service and will use them again if I ever have the misfortune of experiencing lock problems in the future.\n\nEdit: Not even 20 mins after this review was up Shay called and apologized for being late to the appointment. He stated he would refund the service fee. I was very surprised and pleased that he took the time to look at the reviews and actually cared.

We were told that bottomless brunch was available for $25 per person and that each person needed a meal in order to be served. That worked for us because it was exactly what we planned to do. We were brought small carafes of orange juice and cranberry juice and Antonio filled our glasses with champagne.\n\nTo eat, we shared the black truffle fries, bacon wrapped dates, crawfish beignets, and bianca flatbread. For our mains,  a friend and I shared the crab benedict and apple fritter french toast. The bacon wrapped dates were incredible, and we were able to add an additional piece to make it 4 instead of the 3 it usually comes with. Others tried the Ancient Grains Salad and the Shakshuka. Everything was a hit! \n\nWe did not feel rushed to leave, and continued to pick at our plates while we chatted and drank our mimosas.

Some go in for the relaxation, new age-y, hot stone, aromatherapy factor, while others, like me, are in constant, back-twisting, jaw-clenching pain that ranges from ""let me turn my entire body around to see that big boulder careening down the hill towards, cuz I can\'t turn my neck"" to ""yes, perhaps heating up that big boulder and dropping it on my back will relieve me of this @#$!# back pain.\n\nBoise Therapeutic Massage Center is of the latter massage variety.

The first time I went I got a lady who was new to the company (yeah, I know what you\'re thinking), but she was OK.

I plan on returning and editing this review after more visits. Let\'s start with me calling less than 24 hours in advance and was able to book an appointment for the next morning. It was nice knowing I didn\'t have to book a week in advance. The woman on the phone when I booked was extremely nice. I\'m being a little nit-picky, but I would have only had a 60 min appointment had I not asked. This seems typical for most spas, massage centers I have made appointments at. Unless asking for 90 min or something special you will be booked for a standard 60 min massage. Still, there was no problem with the times I wanted and being able to have a 90 min massage. \n\nQuick notes before I describe my session:\n- BTM was a nice, clean facility\n- I arrived a bit early for standard paperwork since this was my first time there and they were already ready for me and had me do paperwork after. I liked this because I received the entire 90 min and not a single minute was wasted on filling out new patient info \n- My CMT actually listened to what I wanted/needed! Bonus points\n- The staff was very friendly\n- I am already recommending to friends\n\nMy session was with Kim, and I have already told at least one friend about her. Most of my experiences with MT is they ask what the issue(s) is, but I never feel like they listen to what I just said. My workout consists of a lot of body-weight squats. My glutes and legs are my problem areas. Typically my experiences with MT is they ignore what I said about my legs, work on my back, end up with 30 min on my legs, and then say they could use the whole hour on my legs. Yes, I know. That is why I said focus on my glutes and lower legs. \n\nAdditionally, it is rare that I have had a MT really work my glutes. I get it....not necessarily a body part people want to touch. However, I have only had one MT really ever work my glutes the right way. Kim listened to what I said about my glutes and legs, and wasted no time getting into them, I immediately started feeling better after she finished my right side. This fact alone will have me returning to her at least twice a month! \n\nThe best compliment I believe I can give, is to say Kim actually listened to what I had to say about the problem areas. She worked on these areas for the majority of my appointment. There have been countless massages where I felt I over paid because I didn\'t receive what I was asking for. If you are asking, ""ok, but does he tell them during the massage?"", yes...yes I do! \n\nI plan on returning in a couple of weeks. If my experience continues this way then I will definitely give them 5 stars. It was a great massage. I felt so good after, and even 24 hours after I still feel great (even with delayed soreness which is typical for me).

For anyone who knows about curls I am a 3C hair type. So, Dominican salons usually do the best job at straightening my hair. Unfortunately I didn\'t have the time to sit in a Dominican Salon for over 3 hours, so I decided to try a blow out salon. I called a competitor, but the call center couldn\'t let me speak to a person in the salon, so I called Blowbar instead.\n\nI explained my hair type to the receptionist and told her that I wanted a vintage look for the Yelpie Awards. She told me that my hair type is common and that she was booking me with one of the best stylists, Victoria Acosta. \n\nSo, I made my appointment on a Monday for Thursday morning at 11am. I get there, was greeted politely, was asked if I wanted a drink and I waited for my stylist. A woman walked in and I started letting her know what I wanted. She had a perplexed look on her face because she said I was only booked for a blowout and not a curling iron style and that 45 min was not going to be enough for my hair. She asked if when I made my appointment I told the receptionist all of that and I said, ""Of course, I was worried how everything was going to turn out because of my hair type. I was specifically booked with Victoria because of it. The woman says, ""Oh I\'m not Victoria, but that\'s Victoria and she\'s booked too. I can definitely do your type of hair, but they just didn\'t book you enough time."" I showed her my text message confirming the appointment with Victoria that I got on Monday and Wednesday, then I realized that less than an hour ago (10:10 am) I got another text showing that my appointment is with Tia. So the salon changed my appointment last minute for some reason. Inside I was starting to boil, but Tia was so concerned and sweet and said, ""hold on a sec"". She talked to the front desk and to Victoria. Tia ended up washing my hair then Victoria took over the rest. I believe Victoria pushed her appointments back to accommodate me and I appreciate both Tia and Victoria for doing that. This would be the only frustration, however it wasn\'t long and it was rectified immediately.\n\nI was so impressed with my results. Victoria blew my hair out quicker than I\'ve ever had it blown out in the past. I\'m so used to sitting in a salon for over 3 hours (which is why I barely go to salons...I have no patience).  I showed her a vintage pinup picture and asked if she could do it...and she DID! My hair came out EXACTLY like the pic. I was so worried that it would fall by the event, so she used some serious hairspray and she pinned my curls in the back so they wouldn\'t fall from my hair weight. Victoria assured me that the curls would stay in and I should have no worries. I got to Blowbar at 11am and left at 12:45pm...not only with my hair blown straight, but also a vintage hairstyle! That\'s a record! \n\nI got compliments on my hair all night long! Victoria did not lie about the curls staying in my hair. My hair held up all night and the curls stayed in my hair for a week...even after workouts (the hair near my scalp of course started to curl after sweating during workouts, but I was able to rock a pony with lovely curling iron curls for several days)! \n\nI now feel confident to book Blowbar for a regular blowout when I want to rock a straight do. I can\'t wait to bring my daughter here too.\n\nProfessional, Clean, Quick and able to rectify a problem quickly. Definitely 5 stars!', ""This was my first experience here for a formal evening event to have my hair and makeup done.  The vibe was not relaxing there was drama at the counter when we were all we in.  A dissatisfied customer was expressing her complaints and was being handled.  Once we did checked in there wasn't a welcome, or tour or explanation of services or membership, etc.  no-one offered anything to drink.  \n\nWe started w makeup appt before hair which wasn't ideal since hair washing  disturbed some of the foundation.  Overall there were too many excuses in the disconnect with appt setting and vibe from our service providers.  I don't plan to return here for the cost $65 for evening makeup and the blow out $40 & curl $15, the outcome was meh compared to level of service given in comparison at the DryBar in SoHo.  I feel like the cost wasn't the issue as much as the feeling of cohesion &  customer satisfaction here.  \n\nI spoke to the manager and got her apology but it seemed insincere and again chalked up to the new staff they have.  Management didn't seems to care to earn our repeat business either."", 'I have been to Blowbar twice for a blowout with curling iron, one of those times I also got my makeup done.\n\nThe first time I went was to get my hair done for my engagement photos.  The stylist spent a good hour plus on my hair, enquired about how my hair held curls and applied styling products and the application of the curling iron based on my hair type.  My hair looked fantastic and the curls held perfectly.\n\nI liked this stylist so much that I asked if she was available to do my hair for the wedding.  She said she was not working that early that day but would ask her supervisor if she could come in early and then she would call me to let me know.   I never received a phone call.  \n\nThe second time I visited was for my wedding a different stylist who treated my much differently than the other stylist.  I showed her pictures of the stylist and explained that it was my wedding day.  She did not give me a full blowout at she said she was going to be curling it anyway.  She did not apply products that would help my hair hold curls or withstand other environmental factors such as humidity.  It was as if she was trying to get done with my hair was quickly as possible.  She spent less than an hour on my hair and it looked nothing like the picture or my hair on the day of my engagement photos.  After leaving, my hair began to fall quickly and the curls did not  last long.  They completely fell out prior to the ceremony.  \n\nAs for my makeup the day of my wedding, I could have done it better myself.

We got takeout from here primarily because it was one of the few places that were open on Thanksgiving. We actually tried to order from 2 other restaurants before hitting Thanksgiving jackpot with Sher-e! Much like any Thanksgiving meal we were quite stuffed by the time we were done and I definitely needed to nap off all those good eats. \n\nWe shared the mushroom chicken, chicken biriyani, mixed vegetables and some naan. It was all very securely packaged for takeout in a mix of white paper box (Plain basmati rice) and round plastic containers for the curries and biriyani. The naan was wrapped in paper and foil. \n\nI loved the seasonings and spices in each dish. We requested it mild spice and I felt they delivered just the right amount. It was still a little spicy but just a subtle little hint of it in each entree. The white rice was soft and fluffy and while the biriyani was good flavor wise, I thought the rice was just a tad overcooked. The naan itself was a little unevenly cooked as one piece was still a little doughy in the center but had black charred bits in the thinner parts of the bread. Seems like the oven it was cooked in was too hot perhaps? \n\nPortions were plentiful and it was enough to satisfy 2 adults and one toddler with leftovers to spare. If I were craving Indian food, whether on a holiday or not, I feel like Shere-e is a solid choice."", ""The food is very good.  The sauces, curries, naan breads in particular are good.  The naan bread is the softest, most fluffy naan bread in Tucson.  The tandoori chicken is not at the same level.  The mango lassi, which is my favorite drink and will never hesitate to order one, is thick and tart.  It has a strong, strong taste of mango, not a sweet light taste that I prefer.\n\nService is fast when the restaurant is near empty, but this restaurant is hardly ever near empty.  So if there are a lot of people you will be waiting a long time before getting your check, or the other half of your meal, but your water glass will always be full.\n\nThe decor is hideous.  White and light green, glass table tops, white paper place mats.  The dining area is limited to one oblong room with a window facing south.  Each time the door opens a series of sun streaks sweep across the interior and onto everyone's faces.  It also gets quite loud making an intimate conversation difficult.\n\nOur standard Indian cuisine includes a 1/2 order of tandoori chicken, shahi paneer, one order of garlic naan and two mango lassi's.  This comes out to $24 at most places, here this comes out to $29 (before tip)."", ""Upon walking into Shere Punjab, you get hit with the wonderful aromas of Indian spices, and if you're an Indian food fan, your stomach is going to start rumbling.  Prepare to get your eatin' on.  \n\nAs for what dishes to choose, I have to say my top dish is Tikka Masala...and I believe all of Great Britain can also agree.  Apparently it's the national dish of England, and it very well deserves to be.  The sauce is a creamy tomato-based curry that also has bits of coriander (aka cilantro) in it.  I like it with chicken or lamb.  This was my gateway drug to Indian food, and I've never gotten over it.  Eat it with some garlic naan (fluffy Indian flatbread); you won't be disappointed.  \n\nFor those of you who are a bit hesitant about diving right into Indian food, I suggest trying out their lunch buffet.  For $9 or so, you can try 5-6 different dishes with rice, naan, vegetables, and yummy appetizers such as samosas.  PLUS, it's all-you-can-eat.  Go back for seconds...thirds...fourths...  Also, don't forget to try their desserts:  sweet, syrupy doughnut holes called gulab jamun and their rice pudding called kheer.  I eat them together in the same dish.  The sweetness of the gulab jamun is tempered by the light flavors of the kheer.  Absolutely delightful!\n\nThe best way to eat at Shere Punjab?  With friends/family and eat your dishes family-style.  You can have some of my Tikka Masala...because I want some of your Korma.  Food always tastes better when you're eating in good company.  \n\nShere Punjab is my favorite Indian food place here in town.  I went there tonight for some take-out and their dining hall was almost full...on a Monday night!  It warms my heart when I see our local gems staying busy.""]",0.5,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,1.0,30.0

The tour is not focused on food sampling as others that I\'ve been to in other cities (Asheville, NC is phenomenal), but more so on the history of food and cuisines in New Orleans.

The tour guide (Preston) was very informative and funny but sometimes he overdid it and we felt we can't really take a break to breathe. For the last restaurant, we waited about 40 minutes for the bread pudding (when we could've just talked to people and hang out) but he lectured at us for the entire time about everything including his past and current life situations. It would be nice if he considers the fact that many people might be too tired to listen to his stories and may have a difficult time understanding his accent (especially if like me they're not from the South).

I made a 1pm reservation through OpenTable for a Saturday. As soon as we arrived, the hostess quickly approached us asking whether we\'d like to sit indoors or outdoors - we chose to sit outside. It was one of the last few weekends of the summer!\n\nWe started our brunch off with a couple drinks - a beer for him and the Dear Prudence cocktail for me. Both were promptly served. My cocktail was kind of disappointing. It came with gin, Drambuie, grapefruit and champagne. The waitress warned me that the cocktail would have a whiskey taste to it because of the Drambuie but I was totally fine with that. Honestly, that\'s what pushed me to get it. It was something different from my usual drink of choice. Sadly, I didn\'t get that ""whiskey taste"" at all. The drink was pretty weak and I later wished I had just ordered a glass of champagne or wine instead of the cocktail. \n\nThe Always Sunny Turkey Melt that I ordered for my entree was alright. The roasted turkey was good, but I felt like the egg was a little over cooked and the English muffin it came on was dry. I think it would have tasted a lot better if the egg was a bit runny. My entree came with a side of potatoes and a salad which were both grwat. I especially enjoyed the potatoes. They were really well cooked and tasty. \n\nAll of the staff at The Love was very sweet. I appreciated the prompt service and our waitress checking in on us during our meal. For dessert, we enjoyed some carrot cake and the team was kind and thoughtful enough to include a ""Happy Birthday"" message on the plate after finding out we were there for a birthday celebration. \n\nDespite the good service though, I won\'t be hurrying back here due to the subpar food. The restaurant is quite beautiful, so if I am to return, it would be to check out the inside and I\'d likely just stick to a glass of wine and get my food elsewhere.', ""Love The Love!\n\nThis Steven Starr signature restaurant is perfect for it's nuanced approach to New American.

It was a nice morning out so the people watching was pretty decent as was the general view of the outside. As with many places when dining out during COVID, we were limited to 90 minutes for our meal. We had to wear masks when moving around and only allowed to remove when seated and while eating or drinking. \n\nOur waiter started us off with waters and coffee and read off a special of strawberry scones with lavendar whipped cream as part of their Valentine's day menu. We were intrigued and ordered those in addition to our mains - a turmeric ravioli for her and a beet risotto for myself. There was some mix up with our scones and our neighboring table received our order. It was fixed in a jiffy and the waiter was nice enough to comp the scones given the snafu - thank you!\n\nThe meal was delish! I loved the fresh scones and lavender infused whipped cream it came with. Great way to start a brunch - filled with flaky bits of butter and carbs!\n\nWe worked our way through the scones pretty quickly and when our mains came out, we were ready to switch it up to something savory. The meals were definitely well developed and each bite had exceptional flavor! \n\nOur service was great - plenty of check ins, water and coffee refills, and friendly attitude.

Great combination of flavors with the veggies and sauce  - definitely filling.

My friend ordered the $14 crab cake - it was a good size and was definitely packed with crab but the menu described a dish with what seemed like side items - the ""sides"" (turnips two different ways and ""pepper"" (sauce garnish) are ""garnishes."" It was good but flavor notes were heavy on the pimento which is not my thing for crab cakes but it was still delicious 5/5\n\nI ordered the $13 octopus which came with a small serving of green beans - a true portion of beans  but the octopus tentacle (yes ONE) was small and I finished it in three small bites. Besty had a bite too. We both proclaimed It was the best octopus We\'ve ever tasted- perfectly cooked and flavored! After dinner, we drove by three popular restaurants known for their octopus and I kept saying , ""WOW! The octopus was way better than (insert any local, popular Mediterranean restaurant name here) YES IT WAS REALLY THAT DELICIOUS 10/5\n\nDrinks 5/5\nBesty ordered a cherry gimlet - she said it was delicious but the serving is small and she said it wasn\'t very strong.

Also they use those really expensive, Italian cherries - i forget the brand name but they\'re usually $14/jar (if you order that drink you will receive ONE small cherry). 5/5 (even though it\'s small)\n\nOther notes and notices:\nThey give you a small bag of complimentary delicious popcorn per table (I guess it is instead of bread service?). My octopus should have included a small slice of smoky toast or good Italian bread to sop up the delicious sauce but it was surprisingly absent.\n\nI saw other (yes here we go again) DELICIOUS-looking items on nearby tables. The crawfish Mac n cheese was definitely shareable and the nearby toddler was flipping out because she loved it - her parents couldn\'t give her more fast enough it was hilarious!

If you aren\'t hungry you can still enjoy the evening because you can just go there to listen to some sweet tunes and enjoy the expensive but high quality bar offerings and plenty of complimentary popcorn :)', 'This spot was our jam back in the day when it was Kildares. On a tour of of old haunts in honor of my husband\'s recent birthday we decided to stop by despite being a bit super partial to the old residents. We were actually quite impressed with the renovations and the new vibes! \n\nThe place is super hip and obviously inspired by music. I loved the photos of my old pals Janis and Jimi downstairs, and certainly the guitars and old school blues concert posters on the walls upstairs in the ""juke joint"". \n\nWe came for date night and enjoyed live music by  Big Soul Chicken band. (Check their site for a listing of upcoming performers.)They were awesome and played their original tunes as well as classics we all know and love. Perfect place to come whether you want it as background music or more of a concert/dancing type of night. \n\n While the ""juke joint"" wasn\'t nearly as nitty and gritty as the authentic ones I\'ve been to on the back roads in Mississippi and in the south in general, it certainly gave me a bit of that area I desire from time to time. There\'s not enough live music places in the city in my opinion. Let alone free to enter ones! This place is a great find! \n\nIt\'s super groovy, dark and sexy feeling up in the juke joint. Lots of candles and even a fireplace. Perfect for a night out with my love! \n\nThe cocktails were awesome and ran about $26 for two before gratuity. We chose the Lynchburg Basil Lemonade (Jack Daniels, Fresh Basil, Homemade Southern Lemonade) and the Black Cherry Gimlet (Black Cherry Vodka, Vanilla, Lime, maraschino Cherry). I honestly cannot choose a favorite! Both were carefully crafted, alcohol filled and absolutely delicious! Whiskey and Bourbon are obviously their specialty and I really loved the barrels scattered about doubling as side tables! The beer list was rather extensive also! \n\nThe menu, like the entire place, is influenced by the South. They have a late night menu, kids menu, brunch, lunch and dinner. We can\'t wait to return perhaps for brunch with the kids or ""social hour"" as they call it. There\'s daily specials during that 5-7pm period with $4 wines, $3 brews and $4-$6 smaller plates. The mushroom and kale salads were calling my name and the crawfish Mac and cheese sounds right up hub\'s alley. \n\nSuper fun find!! \nKiosk parking. Lots of spots.

Parking in the area can be a challenge, so if you're driving in, give yourself plenty of time to park. After circling around we stumbled upon a great spot. Great start to the night!\n\nI started with a glass of champagne, because it's a Tuesday - let's celebrate! \n\nAs I mentioned it was restaurant week and what drew me to this menu was the 4 courses, dessert is typically wasted on me so I liked the fact there were 3 courses with savory options. \n\n1st course - Quail and Smoked Wings - Yes to both! I ordered the quail, it was small, but the pesto was incredible. My BFF ordered the smoked wings. You.must.order these! Tender, smoky, and needs nothing to accompany it. \n\n2nd course - Foie Gras and Meatballs - I have not had foie gras in a long time. Why? Oh wait, it's not the healthiest option and it's nice to indulge occasionally. The presentation was beautiful and the figs were perfect. The meatballs were tender and good, but I could have eaten 2 more plates of the foie gras.\n\n3rd course - Swordfish and Fried Chicken - I ordered the fish and it was cooked perfectly. I loved the radishes and used it more like a taco. The fried chicken was so stinking tender. The only thing is everything on the plate was fried, it would have used a vegi or starch that wasn't fried to break up the heaviness. But you can't go wrong with it, it's amazing and a very large portion. \n\n4th course - Remember when I said dessert is lost on me. Not here. I ordered the panna cotta - perfectly set, not too sweet, creamy. Just a perfect way to end the meal. I did also try the beignets and they were great. \n\nIt was a fantastic meal and hit the spot of craving indulgence without walking away hating myself for eating so much. The menu was balanced with options for those who want to watch their waistline along with those who are craving some good comfort food.""]",0.75,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.0,1.0,30.0

I would recommend 2 - the Mongolian Beef and the House Cantonese Chow Mein.  The House Cantonese Chow Mein is made with pan-fried noodles topped with chicken, beef, shrimp, and bbq pork.  With this dish, Jennifer T does have a point that the sauce is pretty salty.  However, saltiness aside, the taste has somewhat of a good flavor be it the all too familiar and ever-present ""brown sauce"" found in so many Chinese/American dishes.

Being a former window film installer myself, I am hesitant to pay someone for work I can do myself. However, I brought my vehicle to these guys because they install SunTek film, which is some of the best stuff on the market and I no longer have the means to order SunTek film. Their installer, Alex, did a great job on all the windows and I was very pleased with his work. He informed me that he most likely would not be able to do my UV kit because the rearview mirror bracket on my particular vehicle is very tricky and he didn\'t want to risk breaking the windshield. I totally understood and would have done the same thing myself. He said we would need to reschedule that portion of the work for a time when their lead installer was working. I agreed and was on my way. The following business day, I called to schedule that time and the lady who answered the phone said that this particular installer was out in the field and to check back the next day. I did that, and continued to be pushed back. After a whole week of trying to schedule work I had already paid for, I kept getting denied. Finally, I went into their store and asked for my money back on that portion of the installation. One of the people came out of the office with a new invoice saying the refund amount would be $75, when $125 is what I had prepaid for the UV kit and windshield strip. When I presented the original invoice, they got very defensive and said ""we never charge $125 for those. We gave you a discount."" Which simply wasn\'t true. The math didn\'t add up and they were trying to keep an additional $50 in their pocket. When I questioned that, another guy in the office said ""Just give him the money back, he\'s not worth the argument."" \n\nSo, after all this, why the 3 star review instead of 1 star? Well the first part of my experience here was actually quite good. Scheduling the appointment was easy and convenient, the receptionist was pleasant, and the installation was very clean with only minor defects.

We were quite disappointed when we forgot to take our leftovers with us at the end of the night (we attributed our forgetfulness to the wine).\n\nThe reason I'm only giving Capitol Cellars 3 stars is due to the service. Our server was kind enough, and well versed with regard to the wine selection. However, when our entrees were brought out he asked if we would like ground pepper. We both said yes, and then proceeded to wait over five minutes for him to return, which didn't occur until we waved him down and inquired as to the delay. Along with the odd pepper situation, I wasn't provided a knife for which to cut my prime rib with. It was very tender, but not to the point of only needing a fork. Sitting and staring at our food while waiting for pepper and utensils for several minutes put a bit of an unkind edge to the rest of the meal. They were not busy at the time of our visit.\n\nWe would certainly give them a try again sometime in the future, perhaps after the staff has become a bit more seasoned. When we do I'll be sure to update my review."", ""******6 star high class restaurant******\nThis surpasses all expectations and experiences in Boise. I have been here on several occasions at various times ranging from breakfast to holiday dinners. I'm always blown away with amazing service and beautifully prepared food. Sorry no pictures, lived in every moment to its proper fullness! No detail was spared in service or the food. Call it the old Chicagoan in me, but I adore the secret, out-of-the-way, speak easy location. Located in the lower level in the Belgravia Building on 5th and Main, be sure to plan to park at Addies across the street  ($3 parking I think at night) because street parking could be full. This is a high- class evening special, I personally appreciate it when other patrons dress for it."", ""This was our second visit to Capitol Cellars, and we're so pleased with the consistent experiences we've had. Tonight, I had the sea bass and my husband went for the seafood risotto. We also ordered side salads. Everything we ate had a little something extra to make it wonderful: ultra tender, earth-sweet greens, deliciously seasoned and crisp fish skin, a deeply layered saffron-white wine broth, and sauces that beautifully complimented each item on the plate. I love when I have high hopes for a meal, and they're exceeded. \n\nService is impeccable, as always: friendly, prompt, professional and polite. The ambience is dim and on the quieter side, without being stodgy; a perfect place for an anniversary dinner or a date with a good friend. Nothing about Capitol Cellars is a miss.""]",0.3,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.2,1.0,30.0
rqaIe-61HKlWaGYmVwlw8Q,Petite 4,Boise,ID,43.6046712,-116.22804,4.5,121,"Food, Restaurants, French, Beer, Wine & Spirits","['food', 'restaurants', 'french', 'beer', 'wine & spirits']",3.0,"['In the way of word association, when host/owner DK Kelly asked ""How was everything?"" as our party of four departed, the single word that popped to my tongue was ""Extraordinary!"".  Wiith that exclamatory emphasis.  Each element of this little jewel of a French bistro created by husband DK, who manages front of house, and wife Sara, who is the Chef running the kitchen, adds up to perfect.  Being fans of the Kelly\'s earlier Boise venture, remarkable sandwich eatery \'bleubird\', we arrived at Petite 4 with lofty expectations.  Expectations were exceeded on every level for charming hospitality, artful ambiance, splendid service and wonderful food.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:  The English noun restaurant is derived from the French verb restaurer - to restore.  As in to restore the spirit.  And so it does to dine at Petite 4.  It is joy filled.  Go!\n\n A TIP:  reservations are essential if you want table seating and they take calls for reservations only between 3-5pm on Tu-Sat.  \n\nHOSPITALITY:   DK makes gracious hospitality seem effortless.  It is a gift.  The charm of ""all are welcome"" starts from the time reservations are made and continues through being greeted at the door as if you are the special ones they have been waiting for as you are escorted to your table.  Lovely to be made to feel welcome like that.\n\nFOOD: Ooh-la-la!  Each bistro-inspired dish is a feast for the taste buds and delightfully plated in feast for the eyes.  Portions are ample.  Something we learned on our first visit when four of us shared two starters and each ordered a seafood dish individually followed by two shared desserts is we would have been better to share a couple of those seafood dishes between us because we were full to the gills. Whether you like to order dishes to share or prefer your own dish to savor, this is the place.  From my seat I could see Chef Sara Kelly and her kitchen team working to create fabulous food. Imagine the skill needed to be able to produce this kind of excellence five days week!\n\nSERVICE:  EJ made wonderful food taste even better through the quality of her service in striking the exactly right balance of professional, knowledgeable and friendly.  She clearly loves her job and made us love our experience there.  She could answer our questions about the restaurant, the menu and also those we asked about ingredients in various dishes.  Her timing of plates to the table was perfect.  Her handling of the wine service for both bottles was expert (and she was gracious when some was spilled by us and needed cleaning).  We felt extremely well tended but never rushed or hovered over.\n\nMENU: Cleverly and logically arranged at the same time to make it both fun to read and easy to follow for understanding all a-la-carte options.  The only difficult thing is choosing among excellent alternatives and leaving room for dessert. (Lemon meringue pie has true French meringue!)   Daily specials offered separately.  Prices run @$3 - $22 regular menu and specials.  See menu link here.  http://eatatpetite4.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DinnerMenu_FINAL.pdf \n\nLIBATIONS: Good wine list with several by glass (@ $8-11) and many by bottle (@ $30-78) from both domestic and European vintners.  We chose bottles but noted the couple next to us received generous by-glass pours.  Top quality stemware is used.  Being old winos...umm long time oenophiles...we appreciate these things.  There are also creative house made sodas, some beers and French Press coffee.  \n\nDESIGN DETAILS:  Every element, from interior to table settings to menu format, is perfectly woven together in the sophisti-whimsy hallmark style of the Kellys with ambiance that nearly says ""Bienvenue!"" right out loud.  This is loving care translated to the visual.  From the green ceiling, with an artichoke painted on it over the open kitchen, to the gold-colored upholstery on tufted banquette backs and high chairs at bar, to café chairs at tables, to gold and white geometric wallpaper, to round mirrors, to patterned floors, to mismatched flatware, to quality dishware, to bistro cloth napkins, to the pinstriped aprons worn by servers, it is all ""aaahh...""somely done.  \n\nSEATING:  9 or 10 standard height two-top tables with banguette backs and cafe chairs on the aisle side that seat maybe 18 - 20.  Another 7 or so upholstered high seats at the bar.  A few backless metal stools tucked at kitchen counter.  Kitchen counter seating is for walk ins.  If you need standard height seating, be sure to ask for a table when you reserve.  \n\nACCESSIBILITY: ADA parking near front door.  Level in the door and all on one level.   Ample aisle space from door to tables.  Looks like wheelchair space for seating on aisle side of tables. (I have MS so notice.)\n\nLOCATION & PARKING:  Bench neighborhood.  Private lot.\n\nSPECIAL EVENTS:  Introducing monthly European brunches and monthly prix-fixe Sunday dinners. See web site.', 'Every year on July 19 my husband and I celebrate our wedding anniversary with glass of wine in hand and good meal in front of us to consider whether we want to \'renew the contract\' for another twelve months.  Tonight we re-upped the contract (God willing) at Petite 4 with glass of champagne and sharing a splendid bowl of bouillabaisse, the night\'s special as if they knew why we were coming and made it just for us.  This dish with octopus, head on shrimp, clams, scallops, and halibut in lobster-saffron stock with tomato, fennel, herbs and pernod was dee-luscious.  Easily shared by two and mon mari was so chivalrous as to peel the shrimp for me.   We asked for soup spoons so as not to miss a drop of maybe the best bouillabaisse broth we have ever enjoyed.  (My only recommendation is to serve moistened \'finger tip towels\' for clean up when serving shrimp to peel and \'finger food\' like clams in broth.)  \n\nIs there anything more romantic, even nearly four decades in to a union, than sharing a great dish a wonderful space with warm service?  (That was a rhetorical question. You saw the Spaghetti Dinner restaurant scene in ""Lady and the Tramp"", right?)  Even the music was perfect tonight for the mix and the volume.  A very good finish to one marital year and start to another. \n\nI know this is overkill - three reviews for the same restaurant in a year\'s time and two only a week apart.  This one is the end of my Petite 4 reviews for good.  But this eatery is so good.  \n\nAnd I\'ll close with a TIDBIT that highlights why Petite 4 continues to evolve as a Bench neighborhood gem:\n\nFRIDAY AFTERNOON CLUB - Tonight we discovered Petite 4 is trialing a new - July 19 their first - Friday Afternoon Club cart on the side of the building on...you guessed it...late Friday Afternoon into Evening.  On this first evening they were serving fresh oysters or shrimp cocktails or tins of fish with the charming, beautiful and patient Maddie at the cart.  (You may know her from front of house service at Bacquet\'s French restaurant in Eagle where she made an impression on us and that she recognized us from the earlier venue and greeted us warmly shows why she is so good at customer facing hospitality work.)\n\nThe drill is you order what you\'d like to eat from the cart and you can also choose bottled beer, Sophia sparking wine in cans or Rose at the cart (and we are told real champagne available to come from inside out too) and carry your eats and drinks to stand at the rail on the side of the building or if lucky snag a couple of the handful of sit down chairs there to enjoy it.\n\nWe\'re not so much the right demographic for this ourselves, creaky as we have become and me with MS, to be ""rail birds"" for a nosh.  But we appreciate what a good idea this is for fit for some folks.', 'Worth an update, in particular for visitors to Boise who may use Yelp to do planning, to say while Petite 4 has not yet reopened for inside dining  as of July 2020 you can still enjoy their food and support owners Chef Sarah (Beard nominated semifinalist for 2020) and DK Kelly through four different weekly pop-ups that offer something to fit everyone.  \n\nFor three of the four pop-up take-aways, see below, orders need to be placed and paid (credit card) in advance, quantities are limited and when you order you choose a pick up time (at the south side parking area window):\n\n1) Wednesday lunchtime sandwiches and sides (using their former Bleubird model of great food and \'woohoo\' that includes their potato salad).  \n\n2) Friday ""date night"" 3-course dinner menu for take out sized for two.\n\n3) Sunday chicken ""family dinner"" with choice of roasted or fried chicken with sides and dessert in take out sized for four.  \n\nThey are also doing ""grab and go"" that is first come first served (credit card only at purchase at south side window):\n\n4) Saturday morning treats, like hot chocolate, coffee and baked goods.

In 2012, four business travellers to Boise came close to having their love of Indian cuisine die after one of the worst overall dining experiences in a long, long time.  The owners of the Taj Mahal should be ashamed of themselves for their ineptitude in service and serving their overpriced and middling Indian food.  Awful, awful, awful all around.\n\nI\'d like to quote from some of the other reviews on Yelp of this restaurant before I get into my personal experience: Christy M. gives 5 stars and says \'It is expensive, but that\'s just Indian food."" Ugh, Christy, have you ever been to Devon Ave in Chicago?  Cheap and amazing Indian food does go togehter but obviously not here at the Taj.  Rina K. gives 3 stars and states: ""All of the (vegetarian) curries had a slight spiciness, but ultimately just tasted the same. And were so very oily. So. Heavy."" Ugh, then Rina, how could you give 3 stars?  Is it really A-OK to have dishes that taste the same and are oily???  Barf.  David L.  gives 3 stars and states ""Everything is made-to-order, so be prepared to wait a little while."" Ugh, David, I don\'t mind waiting a little while, but 42 minutes after being seated we got our one order of vegetable samosa\'s.  Oh yeah, and the inside of the samosas were COLD!  Fried food that\'s cold, now that is really a special trick...this is not Alinea for goodness sake where one may expect a feat like that, where it is intentional, by the chef!\n\nNow my turn...the Taj Mahal is located on the second floor of a poorly designed building in downtown Boise, take the escalator up if you must.  Once we were seated by the owner we were not acknowledged for at least 15 minutes.  The restaurant had a party of 6, a deuce and our party of 4.  What is it with Boise restaurants and their inability to greet customers promptly and get water to the table in less than 5 minutes?  This is the second Monday in a row that this has happened. Unacceptable.    \n\nAfter waiting 15 minutes we thought it would be best if we placed our drink and dinner order at the same time; we ordered one appetizer and our three entrees for sharing.  The drink ordering was silly; the owner told one of our dining companions that water was only available for those under 16...ok fine, cute and funny, but then when I said I just wanted water he kept staring at me to add an adult beverage, which I didn\'t want...the other three people at the table requested beer and wine isn\'t that enough upselling from water? So one would think that after we ordered our drinks and waters we would get them soon afterwords.  We watied another 15 minutes after that!  30 minutes into the dininig experience and our first drinks arrive.  WTF?  The way the drinks were delivered would have been worthy of a Three Stooges episode: the owner carried two drinks at a time so he had to make three trips to our table to serve our party of four.  Why three trips?  Two beers, one trip.  One water and one white wine, second trip.  One water, third trip.  Curly, can you buy a beverage tray and do it all in one trip? \n\nThe samosas arrived to our table, if you recall, 42 minutes after we were seated, with a runny, thin mint chutney, some raita, and a sweet tamarind dipping sauce.  They were cold so we asked for another order.  With the Jeopardy theme music running through my head I wondered if we were ever going to eat.  We should have left at this point and gone to another restaurant.  We didn\'t.    \n\nFinally our food did arrive.  The Chiken Tikka Briyani was OK, but had too much of that fake tasting curry.  Chicken Korma and Chicken Tikka Masala were indistinguishable from eachother.  I think that\'s what Rina K. said about her veg enterees...same goes for the chicken dishes.  I couldn\'t discern much, if any difference between the two dishes.  Oh yeah, we had some Nan which was by far the best part of the meal.  In addition to the extreme wait to get our drinks and our food, the other aspects of service were deplorable.  Dirty dishes from the 6 top were never cleared from the dining room so we had a view of their stacked plates and empty glassware throughout our meal.  The deuce was desparately looking around to pay someone so that they could leave this hellish restaurant.  Another deuce was seated but wisely decided to leave before they got the full Taj treatment.  When we were finished with our meal our dishes were never cleared.  The owner asked if he could remove my dining companions partially finished beer glass while the remanants of our meals remained on the table.  He said \'no, I\'m not done with my beer\' and then the owner walked away from the table without removing the dirty dishes.  Inexplicable. \n\nIn 1631, Shah Jahan was grief-stricken when his wife died during the birth of their 14th child.  In 2012 I was grief-stricken at having chosen to have dinner at Taj Mahal Boise.', ""This review is going to read a lot like my review of Maru Sushi, so here goes:\n\nAfter being spoiled with the amazing Indian food in Portland (Plainfield's Mayur), San Francisco (Naan n' Curry), and Los Angeles (Manohar's Delhi Palace), we were a little sad to move out to Boise, where we sort of figured mostly white people lived.\n\nCouldn't have been more wrong! After striking out at a few pedestrian restaurants (Madhuban, Bombay Grill), we found Taj Mahal. This is easily, EASILY, the best and most authentic Indian restaurant we have ever tried.\n\nBe ready for a wait and don't complain about it. Mom is the only cook back there and she is making just about everything from scratch. And it is really, really worth it. So order some garlic-coriander naan, enjoy a beer from their surprisingly large and awesome menu (or bring in a bottle of wine [$10 corkage fee]) and get ready for some spicy awesomeness. Buyer beware: if you order your food prepared at the authentic spice level, you will get your ass kicked. In a delicious and pleasing way.\n\nI can't speak highly enough of this restaurant. They took great care of us on our anniversary and I even got some terrific marriage advice from one of the owners. If you fancy yourself an Indian cuisine fanatic, you must try Taj Mahal. Not for the faint of heart or palette!"", ""we were passing through boise and saw the neon signs on the building.  we looked at the japanese menu and of course it is a steak house...we are vegan.  then we decided to try the taj mahal, even though we have amazing indian in boulder, and so it wasn't really a treat.  well, we were wrong!   this place was great... from the moment we walked in, we were greeted warmly.  everyone who worked there, and the owner, were super friendly and helpful.\n\nnot only are they vegan friendly, they have VEGAN dishes listed on their menu!!!  you're just never sure what dishes they might sneak a little cream in, so it was a nice surprise to see this.  \n\nwe ordered the onion baji.  it was good but doesn't quite compare with our own bombay bistro who makes the best baji in the world.  so i am probably just too spoiled.  the mint chutney was really awesome.\n\nfor dinner, we got banghan barta (very rarely found in vegan form), and spinach sabzi daal.  YUMMMMM!!!  it has spice, and it is vegan, and it is yummy delicious.  the rice was amazingly tasty as well.  i think they listened to these reviews, because there is no way i would ever say they did not use enough spice.  very very tasty!\n\nto top it off, they had mango juice for junior, and a surprisingly diverse list of belgian and specialty beers!  so we got indian food and chimay beer...what a combo!  we will definitely come back next time!!!""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

We've gone all over the city and suburbs for 3 years and this was one of our favorites! \n\nThe decor is amazing- giant chandeliers,  colored lights,  giant paintings, flamingo figurines,  mannequins decked out in carnivale garb. You'll fewl like you stepped into a different world (Trinidad, perhaps?) We had the place nearly to ourselves on a Sunday night, and there's a whole upstairs private seating area. Would be a great place for a private party.\n\nThe service is exceptional- we forgot to BYO and the owner and his son brought us a complimentary champagne toast to start (and then left the rest of the bottle!), explained the menu in detail, gave great recommendations, told us the history of the restaurant and really achieved their goal to make people feel like they just stepped into Trinidad and were welcomed into someone's home. They even sent out some plantain cinnamon bites to start!\n\nThe drinks- we tried all 5 and loved the passionfruit juice, the soursop and condensed milk juice, and the hibiscus punch. The peanut butter drink was like a peanut butter milkshake and delicious.  The Mauby (licorice flavor) drink was interestingbut not my favorite (but my friend loved it). Some of these juices would pair well with liquor so keep that in mind when you BYOB!\n\nLast but not least the FOOD- the mix of indian, African, Chinese,  and Carribean spices is super interesting and flavorful. You MUST get the curry goat and the curry mussels you will not regret it. We got the bussa roti (easier to share) with the curry goat and basically licked the plate clean. We also loved the escabiche fish (whole fried fish) and the pelau (like a chicken biryani). The only thing that was a bit of a letdown was the pepper shrimp chow mein (too spicy for us and overall just an odd combo, but I have no doubt this is authentic). The side of veggies were nothing special, but again, I'm sure they're authentic so more of a personal preference. They served everything family style for us which was great. 5 dishes was plenty for 5 people and 3 of us had leftovers.  There are also lots of vegetarian options- we loved the side of pumpkin.

I think had I had their signature dish of the full shrimps in BBQ sauce, I would have loved this place.

When you are comfortable and joking with the staff, you know that it's going to make for a great night. \n\nWe started off with the gumbo which a couple of us split. New Orleans is a great place to go with a group and split anywhere you can. The amounts of food you will be eating is quite a bit, and just trying things gets you a little bit further without the need of pepto bismol continually. Lol. The gumbo was great and the rue itself was probably the best I had while down here. The majority of the table decided to go with the dish that they are most known for and that's the BBQ shrimp. Head on shrimp are sautéed in a butter/pepper/ lemon sauce. It's a peel and eat dish that can be messy, but so worth it. While you're in New Orleans, this is the one dish that you just need to get once, because it surely won't disappoint. This place just does it well. \n\nI'll be back here.

We're wing lovers and usually get the soy garlics, and in comparison to the many that we've tried this one was very salty. And that's why the 4 stars but aside from that it could have been 5 definitely. Great place, I would come back for the beer and regular wings.

They promote the other businesses and they've gotten involved in local events. They have a local radio show broadcasting out of the store, they've done paint nights, they often bring in breweries for tasting events and they also do first Friday events with special menu items. And even though I missed it, they did an outdoor movie night in the parking lot showing The Sandlot - how cool is that?\n\n5) THE FOOD AND BEER! The menu started small, but over the last few months, it has slowly grown. But even when it started, the wings and fries were amazing. The beer selection has a good variety. And while they can't stock every single craft beer on the market, Frank has made it known that all you have to do is ask and he can get some new beers ordered. Good luck asking some other craft beer outlets to do that for you.\n\nI am lucky that this little gem opened up close by. Frank and his wife are great people and the store is one of the best places to pop up in Northeast Philly.""]",0.625,0.0,0.0,0.375,0.0,1.0,15.0

Let\'s discuss me ordering King Cake\'s every year.  I have a King Cake shipped from the New Orleans area every year.  Okay, almost every year...  My wife is going to read this and tell me I didn\'t order one when I was two years old... Back to the King Cakes... I wasn\'t fully feeling them in recent years, so I\'ve tried some other places and even made my own last year.  This year, I was talking to co-workers and thought about local places.  I knew a place in Reading Terminal Market, didn\'t recall the name, but after some quick yelp searches, remembered it was Beck\'s...  I reached out to them and inquired about the King Cake on Instagram.  After a small conversation, I placed an order.  On the day to pickup, there were a lot of King Cakes there.  I was given mine and I got a quick peek before paying.  \n\n""Wow"" was seriously my first thought.  I think every company from New Orleans ships with FedEx, along with special FedEx boxes.  They\'re almost all the same...  None, that I\'ve found, were this large.  Those are smaller, I\'m sure for shipping reasons, and sometimes filled with custard, but this was so much larger.  \n\nI personally loved the flavors so much more.  The sugar topping, which is usually too much for me, was more balanced on the Beck\'s King Cake.  I enjoyed the more brioche like center.   The only complaint I received, was that someone said theirs didn\'t have a filling in it...  I think they wanted custard...  Which another co-worker won\'t eat, because he doesn\'t eat cream cheese...  Even though I don\'t think there is cream cheese in the Bavarian custard we sometimes get?  I don\'t like people...  Why do I get these things for everyone?  \n\nForgetting the ""extras"" that goes inside, this was a fantastic King Cake and probably the best value I\'ve gotten.  These cakes were decorated nicely too.  You can do that when you aren\'t depending on FedEx to ship...  I can baby, get it, this cake filled with a baby, all the way back to the office in my car.  I wouldn\'t be surprised if this is the place I go for now on...  It\'s more work on my behalf, but I think it\'s worth it.  I\'ll just get a tub of custard and fruit fillings and let people dip in the future...  Just to shut them up...']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0

Based on reviews by Yelp friend Alisha S., we knew what to expect. I couldn't wait to try the spice!\n\nFood:\nRoti Canai 4/5\nThe roti was delicious just as Alisha S. reported, however, we agree with her. The serving of curry dipping sauce was small and  was very thin/broth-y with one small potato chunk and one tiny bit of chicken. The roti was easily a 5/5. \nThe curry sauce though flavorful and packed with heat was more like a broth than a sauce 3/5 we decided the whole dish was a 4/5\n\nThai red curry chicken 4/5\nThis dish though flavorful with a good texture lost a star because my favorite vegetable listed in the description was conspicuously absent (eggplant). The dish did not include my  eggplant nor asparagus much to my neighbor's chagrin, asparagus is her favorite veg. So both of us were disappointed. It did however include red and green peppers, green beans and a few small mushrooms and some tiny bits of yellow pepper and onion confetti. We chose the chicken option. Though there was not an abundance of chicken, it was still pretty filling especially after the roti Canai.\n\nBeef Rendang 5/5\nIt was delivered as described.\nIt was flavorful and packed a lot of heat as did the other two dishes. Also we ended up dipping the leftover roti into that sauce and it held up to it. The beef had a nice texture, a bit like top-round London broil. The sauce is thick, unctuous and spicy. I'd definitely order it again. \nBeef Rendang 5/5\n\nDelivery: 5/5\nThe food was packed well and arrived  piping hot and nothing leaked. The bag was clean- not even a drip! The delivery man was nice, professional and smiled. It was a quick, pleasant exchange! I was disappointed that the roti canai sauce was packed in styrofoam cup/plastic lid. I'm anti styrofoam for hot dishes. No eating utensils were included.\n\nI think we both would  order from Golden Triangle again if we have a hankering for the Rendang - it was delicious! And the next time I've a craving for Roti Canai and don't feel like going to Chinatown, I'd still order from Golden Triangle in spite of the brothy curry sauce because that Roti was divine!"", ""Solid eats, Golden Triangle. And thank you, Yelpers, for the solid reviews which led to my trying this place for takeout while in the neighborhood. I placed an order through Eat24 and the food was ready fifteen minutes later. \n\nMy order was just some basic shrimp pad Thai but it was easily one of the better pad Thais I've had in Philly. My husband started with the roti, which came with a cup of potato curry soup. This four dollar starter is absolutely delicious and a must-get, if you're carbing out on a Sunday (or any day, really). His pineapple rice was nicely balanced with crunchy veggies and great flavor. The price was right as our total came to about $25. \n\nIf it weren't for the $4 delivery fee I'd probably order from here on the reg. For now, I'll stick to pick-up when I'm in the area."", ""I placed a last minute delivery order from Golden Triangle for my boyfriend and I after the great experience I had last time. Unfortunately, it wasn't so great the second time around.\n\nSince I was really impressed with the roti canai and pad thai the first time, I ordered that again. I also tacked on an order of pan fried dumplings this time.\n\nThe dumplings were alright. Nothing good, nothing bad. The roti canai tasted just as delicious as last time, but I couldn't help but notice the quantity of the curry. Are they filling the cup up less and less each time? Last time, I felt as though they skimped me out on a few spoonfuls, and this time, the cup was even less filled!\n\nMy boyfriend and I were craving something spicy, so I decided to get the spiciest level again for the pad Thai. I knew it was going to have a kick to it, but it was honestly unbearable this time. After a few bites and chugging water in between all of them, we both called it quits. \n\nThe inconsistency in this meal was such a disappointment. I was really excited to order from here again and to have my boyfriend try their food, but it was a letdown. \n\nI'll probably order from here again in hopes that I can relive the same experience I had the first time, but not keeping my hopes up too high.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

The outside looked pretty plain, check, the inside seemed pretty sterile, check and and my pup of course spent most of his time smelling all the previous animals in the room, check. But then the people inside seemed to act differently then other techs, they came out one by one to greet Rusty, and he seemed to relax a bit. The tech was super gentle with Rusty, he is a boxer/Dane mix so he is big and frightened easily so it was nice to have techs be so gentle. Dr. Samuels came in and literally spent a solid 45 minutes with me, giving Rusty an exam, giving some vaccines and checking for arthritis (he is also a 10 yr old) and then talking to me about more natural supplements instead of expensive meds. He offered up 2 different brands of glycosomine and since I didn't have a Costco membership, I bought the brand they carry at the vet, it was $55 for a good supply and Rusty thinks they are treats! It was just a nice experience overall to be able to ask a bunch of questions, have the doc spend time answering and making sure I understood and then to leave with a happy and healthy dog.

They do allow one day where you are able to drive-through in your car, but it is quite hectic. The best way is either a hayride, trolley ride or walking. So much interaction and places for photo opportunities... highly recommend walking.\n\nLast year was canceled due to covid, so this year The city allowed them to go through with having the festival open. They also rate the houses and give out awards.  In the central location they have Companies set up for hot chocolate, coffee, bottled water, hot dog's, kettlecorn, etc.  We ended up getting some hot chocolate from the vendor inside Winter Haven and everything they were selling was $6 each (much priced than Starbucks). The kettle corn was decently priced and made fresh right in front of your eyes. And was exceptionally good this year. \n\nThe setup changes every year but some of the Houses stay the same. There are certain areas that always remain the same like candy cane lane and the big Christmas tree. It is definitely a great Christmas light event to see.  Typically it goes on for 2 weeks right before Christmas. Precovid it would go until New Year's however this year ends on the 26th, with the 26th being the drive-through day.

It makes the process all the easier. \n\n\nThe bad: \nNoise level: To say this is a spa, a place of relaxation, it was waaaaayyyyy too noisy inside.

There's an overflow of sorts, maybe people don't know it's there, but my goodness, it needs to be utilized.

To me, bliss is discovering a jewel in the rough where the service and food is indeed extraordinary for less than $10! I've always wondered but now I understand why Mood Café is rated the best restaurant in the city of Philadelphia.\n\n1. First of all, the food here reflects the owner's philosophies. Made with love and care, the intricate blend of ingredients is truly magical. Each flavor is bright, distinct, and amazing. I cannot recommend a specific lassi or chaat because if you choose from any of the literally hundreds of possible combinations, you will not be disappointed. Although Hassan always says kindly that you can have your money back anytime if you do not approve, no one has ever done so.\n\n2. From the wildly popular rose lassi to the many fruits in the chaats, every single food item on the menu is made fresh from scratch. It makes you wonder if he is actually hiding a huge secret elaborate garden somewhere?! \n\n3. Vegan, lactose-intolerant, and can't eat spicy? No worries fellow patrons. At Mood Café, it's all about you, the valuable customer. And amazingly, it doesn't matter what you prefer, because you'll find out it all will taste oh so delicious!\n\n4. Hassan personifies what all business owners should strive to become: friendly, accommodating, down to earth, and funny. When you leave Mood Café, you'll have both your stomach and heart content with incredible food and genuine love. \n\nI honestly wish Mood Cafe was more common in the world. People like Hassan working hard to make the best food with the best service possible, not the cash that comes with it. Simplicity and perfection at every level. Bravo!"", 'The Greeks were wise: one should be on guard against argumentum ad hominem.\n\nI would think there\'s a fair proportion of yelp reviews that disparage an establishment based on what they perceive to be a disproportionate ratio of patrons that have disregard for basic hygiene and attire that doesn\'t wage all-out war on the people\'s sensibilities. I refer to the ""H"" people - not homeless, but hipsters. But, just because the hip.... people find merit in a restaurant, shouldn\'t be held against a restaurant. Admittedly, I have long been challenged in this belief by the places I\'ve given the benefit of the doubt of a trial - but, Mood Café is one of the rare instances where I concur with the H people.\n\nPhilly seems to have its share of establishments where the owner\'s personal interaction is both engaging as well as entertaining to watch. The proprietor of Mood Cafe, Hasan Bukhari, takes less than a minute to size up the customer and make the appropriate recommendation - and then a few more to win your heart.\n\nIt\'s a thoughtful business model. Mood Café provides dozen of variations on Chaat (traditional savory snack in South Asia often served roadside or by food carts) that go beyond the basic Samosa Chaat, Papri Chaat, and Paani Puri to non-traditional combinations that feature salads and meats. Same is the case with Lassi (yogurt based drink, more popular in summer months in the subcontinent) where you can order beyond the typical salted, sweet, or mango Lassi and select non-traditional flavors like Raspberry, Plum, and Mint. Hasan is thus able to offer considerable variety to customers at affordable price points, and helps them navigate through the extensive menu - then he tops that up by assuring them that if they don\'t like it, they don\'t need to pay for it. It\'s not simply the implied money-back guarantee, Hasan ensures that clients aren\'t hassled and leave happy even if that entails offering small sized cups of Lassi to crying toddlers who want to drink what their mothers are!\n\nI tried the Samosa Chaat and liked it (4 stars) because it was liberally sprinkled with Chaat Powder as is tradition and was suitably spicy. But, I thought the fusion of flavors was more to the tune of what I see in Indian restaurants as opposed to Pakistani ones (that typically emphasize one flavor in a dish). What won me over (beyond the fact of finally dining at a clean, hygienic Pakistani eaterie!) was that Hasan doesn\'t simply boast idly on his product - he delivers results. When I asked for advice on which dessert to try: Carrot Halwa or Ras Malaai, he immediately guided me to the Kheer (rice pudding). When I asked: why? He responded that you wouldn\'t have eaten anything like it before. That was a strong assertion, one that I dismissed internally having tried tens of thousands of versions in life, given my sweet tooth. He laughed and said most versions people have tried (especially at Indian buffets that I am all too familiar with) are simply rice boiled with milk. I couldn\'t resist the challenge, and while I didn\'t give him the satisfaction of seeing me eat the rice pudding on the spot - must confess that I was blown away completely when I tasted it. Quite possibly the best version of (sub-continental) rice pudding I\'ve e.v.e.r had.... Solid 5 stars.\n\nSo, go to Mood Café, and say hello to Hasan. Do try the Chaat and Lassi - but save appetite for some of the best rice pudding you\'ll ever eat.', ""Wow, this place is totally unassuming from the outside, but is absolutely worth the walk to the counter for some food. Two lassis and a chaat are about $15. This establishment has very little seating. It is best to get your food to go. It will still be good in twenty minutes, I promise!\n\nI never had street food chaat before, so I was really excited to taste the dish. I had the vegetable samosa chaat, which came with chunks of mango as well. The ingredients that made up the dish all worked really well together. If I hadn't been sharing with Jared J, I would have eaten the entire thing and asked for more--it was absolutely delicious (though a little heavier of a snack than I was expecting because of the samosas). I also had a strawberry pineapple lassi, which was smooth, creamy, and absolutely bursting with flavor. I drank mine in about five minutes flat and was surprised that I didn't get brain freeze.\n\nIn addition to serving great food, Hassan is probably the friendliest and happiest employee in the food service industry. He was very kind to us and talked continually as he made the food. His recommendations were also spot on. Can't wait to go back.""]",0.16666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.8333333333333334,0.0,1.0,15.0

So besides the food being awesome, their cocktails and craft selections are just as good. I really, and I mean I REALLY enjoyed their Southgate Citywide Special. A great concocted blend of Sapporo with a shot of Soju that will make you order one after another. Careful though, it maybe subtle, but this will come up on you like a freight train if you have to many.\n\nIn all the server was on the ball, the food is great, and the beverages are on point. What else could anyone ask for? Minus the size and the closeness of everyone, Southgate is a great spot to visit. I know I\'ll be back, get that KFC ready!', ""My first experience at Southgate was probably atypical.  I got to sit and a slightly higher table, right next to the kitchen and eat all of the things.  The food and beverages were top notch and I just felt very lucky to be there.\n\nI'll just get right to the hits.  Between the KFC and the beef tartare my palate was thrown toward different ends of the spectrum in both flavor and texture.  Presentation wise the tartare won but that was in look alone.  Both dishes were equally delicious.  The tartare felt very precise to me and that made it slightly more impressive.\n\nThe pork bossam and the skirt steak were just heavenly.  Thankfully I was able to get the group to agree on the octopus and the beet salad for some lighter options.  I could have easily sat there and continued to chat and stuff my face with this insanely delicious food.\n\nEver since that meal I haven't been out a great deal due to a new little one at home.  Suffice to say when I get a chance to go out again, I'm making a bee-line for Southgate.  The food here was that good."", ""I am picking up what you are putting down, Southgate! My friend and I had a catch up dinner on Tuesday and it was perfect! \n\nFirst off, I can't even believe the space was formerly Tangier. It has been completely transformed and looks very modern and sleek. While we passed on drinks, there is a full bar and it looks like a great spot to perch for drinks or a solo dinner. \n\nAfter reading the rave reviews of the KFC we had to share some to start, and I have to say it was incredible. We both liked the spicy version more but the garlic soy were also delicious. \n\nFor my entree I went with the bibimbap with beef in a hot stone bowl. It was great, if perhaps a questionable choice on a hot summer night. I will save the sizzling bibimbap for cooler weather in the future. There are lots of other options I'd like to try in the meantime. \n\nOur server was pleasant and on top of keeping our water glasses full. My only gripe was that it was at times hard to hear him and even my friend over the din of the restaurant.

Unlike other storied teams, the Fightin' Phils have never left their original city.\n\nIt took nearly 100 years, but the Phillies were able to win their first World Series championship in 1980 and then again, 28 years later, in 2008. In 1980, future Hall-of-Famer and perhaps the greatest third baseman of all time, Mike Schmidt, led Philadelphia to a 4-2 series win over the Kansas City Royals. In 2008, four-time All-Star pitcher Cole Hamels led Philly in a dominating series performance over the Tampa Bay Rays, 4-1. (Since 2020, Hamels has played for my favorite team, the Atlanta Braves.)\n\nThe Phillies play at Citizens Bank Park, located in South Philly. The ballpark opened in 2004 and is part of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex which includes the adjacent Lincoln Financial Field (home of the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles) and Wells Fargo Center (home of the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers). You can see the complex from the interstate (I-95) as you drive into the city from the airport. It's just across the Delaware River from New Jersey.\n\nThe Phillies haven't done well since 2011, the last year they made the playoffs. From 2012 to present, they've yet to finish a single season above .500 (they finished at exactly .500 twice, in 2012 and 2019), a far cry from their 2008 championship. However, the Charlie Manuel (manager) years (2005-2013), immediately preceding the current playoff drought, comprise a great era in Philadelphia's baseball history. Under Manuel, the Phillies made the playoffs five straight seasons (including that '08 World Series title), had first baseman Ryan Howard named NL Rookie of the Year in 2005 and then NL MVP the following year in 2006, shortstop Jimmy Rollins named NL MVP in 2007, and pitcher Roy Halladay named NL Cy Young Award winner in 2010. Unfortunately, the team hasn't been the same since Manuel's firing during the 2013 season.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, the Phillies have an all-time win percentage of .472 (9,853 wins against 11,032 losses)."", ""I'll admit it - I've never been a baseball fan. Hell, I don't even care for sports. But since the playoffs I've been sucked into the excitement that goes with living in a city whose team is poised to go all the way. And the closer the Phillies got to the series, the more interested I got.\n\nWatching the game on Wednesday night was awesome, even though I was just on my sofa and not out with the rest of the city. And when they won I screamed and woke up the kids. \n\nI love how the win brought our city together, even if it just lasts a few days. And now I'm a fan. Don't hate on me for being late to the party - it's amazing that now I'm a baseball fan at all! Hell must be freezing over...\n\nYeah Phillies! And yeah Philadelphia!

Usually the food is served on styrofoam trays, plastic utensils and come with a side a pickled onions and carrots/veg.  My 8 year old nephew got a chicken quesadilla and everyone one else got different types of tacos per our recommendation.

They often have large white buckets of prepared drink on the counter and you have to look on the counter to know what the offerings will be, despite my excitement to see posted flavors painted on the outside of the building...you get what you get and you don't throw a fit. That day it was jamaica drink and horchata. The restroom situation at Taqueria Pico de Gallo is OK;  one small room with a sink, toilet and urinal for the mens (per my husband)and one room with a sink, mirror and toilet for the women's.

But I WAS tempted, cause that was some good cookin there. I mean, I thought about it.\n\nWe had split that hefty platter when we encountered Gigi and Big R at the Mann Center in September. The deal was kinda pricey at about $15, but I will say that they did give you plenty. We shared it in the rain, under an umbrella on the lawn: Crispy fish fried in long strips, tender sauteed down cabbage, rice and beans, and hot sauce. \n\nSee, that would be a nice lunch for you on the bus, if you indeed made it, except that everyone would want to murder you dead for fillin the bus with the delectable smells, and for enjoying your life or whatever. Yeah, you can't be eating on the bus. I reminded myself of that fact too. That's another thing.  What everyone on the bus has in common with each other is that they inherently loathe everyone else on the bus. Why? I can't tell you, but damn don't it seem to be so. On my way back from NYC one time some cat brought on the bus with him some dirty water dogs from a cart. You could feel the hate for him grow every time he pulled another one outta the brown bag.

It\'s in an odd location, almost like a strip mall, but when you walk in, there are chandeliers and a beautiful ceiling that is painted to look like the sky. The decor is very traditional with Persian style art and images reminiscent of the ancient city Persepolis. The high-backed, floral dining chairs look like all my cousin\'s dining rooms in Iran. They also make their own flatbread there in front of you, which is AMAZING, so it comes out warm. In short, it\'s comfortingly authentic but in a way that is a bit fancy. \n\nThe menu and food here is top-notch Persian cuisine that rivals most of the places in LA. I want to take all my friends here and show them all my favorite Persian dishes. If you were my friends, here is a list of my favorite dishes that I would suggest for anyone who has not tried Persian (or just anyone who likes good food):\n\nMast O Mousir, a creamy, tangy, savory yoghurt dip made with shallots and garlic with berries on top that add just a little sweetness. This is a delicious appetizer to dip your bread in but also tastes great mixed with rice or put on any of the meats. \n\nKash o Bademjan, this is my very favorite appetizer, I even served it at my wedding. It is mostly roasted eggplant that is mixed with whey, garlic, & onions. When done wrong, it can be overly mushy. At the Persian Room, they do it better than anyone. Better than my Iranian grandma, shh don\'t tell her. The  ratio of eggplant to whey is spot on. Then they drizzle whey on top with crispy onions and shallots. Oh it\'s so good! I also put this on my bread, meat and rice. \n\nKebab. Every single one of the kebab\'s are delicious from the Cornish hen (lemony!), the extensive options of lamb, the juicy chicken to the tender steak. However the classic is the ground beef kebab koobideh. It is juicy, tender, full of spices and flavor and always cooked to the right temperature, cooked on long flat skewers so it slides off in one piece. My husband and I like to order one entree plate of koobideh, which comes with two skewers and then add one extra skewer so we have just enough for leftovers but not more rice than we can handle. Now, it may not be the best etiquette, but we like to take the bread, put a piece of meat in it, some of the herbs or a little onion from the sabzy plate (sabzy means greens), dip it in the yoghurt and/or eggplant and then wrap it and eat it like a taco. You\'ll thank me later. \n\nI also recommend everyone has hot, black tea on the side, with just a few sugar cubes. You wouldn\'t believe how well it pairs with everything and it\'s not an authentic experience without it. If you\'re feeling adventurous, try the ""homemade yoghurt drink"" called doogh, a salty, savory, cold, minty, sometimes carbonated yoghurt drink. It\'s so nice to find somewhere that makes it homemade, instead of in a bottle. It\'s like a savory lassi. It\'s incredibly refreshing but can be an acquired taste. \n\nAnd for dessert, you must try Persian ice cream. It tastes like saffron, rose water and pistachio. It often has little bits of frozen cream in it, which sounds weird, but it\'s a heavenly surprise. \n\nThat\'s it, now you can have a near-transcendental Persian cuisine experience too, thanks to the Persian Room finally bringing this food of the Gods to Tucson.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

It had just the right balance of sweet and savory, served in a large plastic container filled with bone in chicken and fried basil. \n\nThe Hong Kong milk tea was alright. It had a light sweetness and I liked the flavor of the tea but was a bit watery rather than milk infused compared to other HK milk teas I've had. The mint mojito latte was OK as well. I liked that they had fresh mint leaves in the drink but the mint flavor clashed with the coffee flavor to me."", ""We will absolutely be coming back here! The chicken bites are out of this world; perfectly peppery and crispy til the last bite. The scallion cake was everything I wanted it to be; crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and perfectly filled. But my absolute favorite dish that I will order every time I come here is the hot & sour soup. Just enough spice to feel it, tangy enough to offset the heat, great balance of ingredients and perfect texture. If you're even remotely debating this place, I highly suggest you make the stop. Plus they do to go orders, so you can call ahead or order online for a very easy pickup option."", 'Hong Kong cafe reminded my partner of growing up, his family is from Hong Kong and Hawaii and he loved this restaurant.  The staff were friendly and helpful and the place was very clean with a modern design. They followed all COVID protocols, we are both fully vaccinated so we were not worried but it was greatt to see.\n\nWe started with the Green tea and mango boba matcha latte and found them delicious.  The green tea was bright and tasted a bit of lemon and possibly jasmine or other floral notes. The boba drink was a perfect blend of the sweet mango and more floral and bitter matcha cut with milk. The staff kept the water and tea refilled and would regularly checkin to see how we were doing.\n\nOur main dishes were bento, the steak and fish.  Both were huge dishes and delicious.  The steak was tender with a slightly sweet sauce that reminded him of the steak he grew up on from his grandma from Hong Kong.  It had a perfectly fried egg and a large amount of rice.\n\nThe second dish was the fish bento which had a crispy, again not greasy, fry and was topped with a sweet corn sauce.  It also had some bok choy and the friend egg.  The sweet corn was a great foil to the fried fish and brought out the natural sweetness in the fish. Both dishes were beautifully presented with the rice holding a great bowl shape.\n\nThe layered pudding desert was wonderful! We had tarp and mango and loved the blend of the two flavors. Like the drinks and meal, the desert was not too sweet so we loved it. We will definitely be back and bring friends!!!!']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

Prior to COVID19 hitting the country, my hubby and I were able to take a trip for my birthday. \n\nThe park is located in Tucson, Arizona and exists on two sides of town. There is Saguaro East and Saguaro West. We looked at both sides on a map and decided to head to the west side. The park ranges in elevation from 2,180 feet in the low lying Tucson Mountains to 8,666 foot Mica Mountains in the Rincon Mountains.  Lots of interesting animals like javelinas, white nose coati's, and evening black bears way up high.\n\nBe sure to take Gates Pass Road as your route to this side of the park. This drive is epic and absolutely magical, filled with luscious green Saguaro's. In case you didn't know, the Saguaro cactus is one of my favorite cactus so I was over the moon excited.\n\nWe arrived at the visitor center so we could pay our entrance fee and grab a map, then off we went to drive to our trailhead. \n\nFor those people who aren't hikers, both sides of the park provide roads designed for sightseeing. Remember to share the road with cyclists.\n\nAfter some off-road driving we arrived at our trailhead. We decided to hike Wasson Peak via the Sendero Esperanza trail which hooked up with the Hugh Norris trail to the top. This was a beautiful trail, very well maintained. So many Saguaros everywhere, one could just get lost amongst these giants! The Saguaro's grow very slowly, only an inch or so during the first 6 to 8 years. They reach full height 40-50 feet at about age 150 years!! They can also grow up to 15 arms and generally die if old age. \n\nOnce we made it to the top, the views were 360 degrees. We could see the Catalina Mountains, Picacho Peak in the distance and the Rincon Mountains. The park is located in the Tucson Mountains.  It was a little chilly up there at the top but so worth it. We took our time coming down and stopped often to take in the pleasing scenery. The park is so vast and open. \n\nThere are several other trails which take you deeper into the park with less people. No pets allowed on the trails which I was very happy about so no dog poop to avoid! \n\nThe west side of the park also features petroglyphs located at Signal Hill picnic area. \n\nWith time not on our side, we only were able to hike a small portion of the park, but we plan to return to hike more of the west and also a peak or two on the east side. \n\nTotal mileage: 7.5 miles RT\nElevation gain: 1643 feet\n\nI highly recommend a trip to and through this park if you enjoy the exquisite beauty of the state of AZ!"", 'Tucson, AZ:  Sonoran Desert immersion, YESS!\n\nFirst time visiting. Despite the forecast in 90sF, and a late start, we loved our drive along the eight mile, paved Cactus Forest Drive. Limited pullouts and parking along this road. Too hot for hiking but the scenery is outstanding for the rich variety of local cacti and wildflowers, set against the Rincon Mountains. The unique Saguaro Cactus is only found in the Sonoran Desert.\n\nThe Visitors Center is located outside the park gate with free parking.

I'd heard some good things, and was expecting a nice meal, but dinner absolutely exceeded my expectations. The space is really cozy and inviting; there aren't too many tables so be sure to make a reservation if you want to eat in the dining room!\n\nMy friend and I shared a bottle of sparking water which was fine, but I would love to see some inventive non-alcoholic options on the menu (currently they have iced tea and soda). \n\nThe food was awesome, and our server was fantastic. We started with buffalo cauliflower which was much lighter than what I was expecting. Here, you could actually taste the cauliflower, and the sprinkling of blue cheese was a nice addition. Next, we had the mushroom carpaccio, which was delicious! It was spread over the plate with some mixed greens and had a hearty sprinkling of parmesan. \n\nMy friend chose the gnudi for her main (really nice!) while I went with the special of the day, a cod and clam chowder. This dish was hearty and loaded with delicious veggies and tons of flavor. Such a perfect cold weather meal! \n\nWe couldn't resist dessert and had the chocolate tart and apple crisp. The tart was definitely my favorite; it was super rich and came with the most fantastic whipped cream and a caramel sauce that was phenoms. Loved it! \n\nScrolling through my insta last night, I saw a photo of some really bomb-looking margherita pizza. Turns out, also from the folks behind Olly! They just opened a concept called Gigi Pizza, which you can access through Olly or a separate door on Bainbridge. Planning my visit!"", ""Olly was not 'A-OK.' It was alright. \n\nI was here to sample a tasting menu. The group (it was mostly twosomes and foursomes) was informed that everything on the menu were things in regular rotation at Olly and also things that the chef felt best showcased the restaurant's style. \n\nChris D'Ambro, the chef, came out between courses to talk about what was just served as well as general chit chat. He seems like a very enthusiastic, down to earth, 'every guy' type man who really enjoys what he does. And so he must with 2 other restaurants-Southwark and Ambra- to his name. \n\nThe tasting event hostess, not associated with the restaurant and whose name I did not get (and if I had, I'd want to have forgotten it) treated the room like she was Sister Strict Nun and we were all unruly charges. When she wanted to talk, she would ring a loud chime and then comment on how 'good' or 'not good' everyone was in quickly ceasing conversation in order to hear her blab. By the end of the evening, I wanted to throw a pitcher of ice water on her and suggest she go back to the imaginary convent to do penance for her lack of social grace. Again-please note-she is not an employee of Olly.\n\nThe venue is a corner location, small, bright (lots of windows) and full of plants and knick knacks. The colors are restfully neutral but the acoustics are horrible. Kalaya, also a new kid on a block not too far from Olly, is the same as far as having a space that holds unmitigated, high level noise. I shared a table with 7 other diners and by the second course, even those of us sitting right next to each other were shouting and straining to hear the person on either side. Maybe that is the new trend in small South Philly restaurants. It does not make for a relaxing dining experience. \n\nThe tasting started with hush puppies filled with corn and shrimp. I found them dry with one corn kernel and nothing else (not a speck of crustacean) in the several I ate. They were served with a side of quartered lemons. The juice from the citrus was all that made them moist. They were served with aioli but not enough of it. Not at all greasy or heavy but not worth the calories, either. My fellow diner took one bite of hers and left the rest. Enough said. \n\nFollowing those bites came charred pole beans in a black pepper vinaigrette with pecorino cheese and basil. I just don't like beans. These needed a lot more char and a lot less pepper. The starch of the beans and the heat of the black pepper was all I could taste. The occasional bite of basil was refreshing but not enough to save the dish.\n\nThe shining course of the evening was charred broccoli ceasar salad. It was supposed to have chicken in it, though there was none found in all the polite, discreet fork hunting I did as I served myself. This had a fish sauce or anchovy funk that danced well with the skillfully charred broccoli. Had I not been in company, I would have just pulled the serving platter over to my own personal space, eaten every morsel of every component, then licked the platter clean. This is something I have been mentally reconstructing so I can enjoy it again at home. \n\nThe next course was Blue Bay mussels in a buttermilk broth. These missed the mark for me, too. The mussels were plump and well cooked but the broth did not taste like much more than salty water. I love buttermilk but this had none of the tang or the creaminess that makes it a special ingredient. The dish was garnished with Olly's house baguette toasts and even soaking the toasts with the broth did not satisfy my search for the lovely acidity buttermilk brings to food. I was glad I'd managed to keep the lemons from the hush puppy course as they at least added the acid I was missing but unfortunately did not save this dish.\n\nAnother gripe I had was with Olly's servers. No one was given fresh plates with new courses. The tables were set with small, round plates that had a lip. Basically tasting plates. Fine for one tasting course but we were expected to try new things with the same soiled plates. A big no. My neighbor, who was a light eater, had so much barely touched food on her plate that she was having a tough time piling a new serving on top of the prior courses. She asked, then I asked for her, that a clean plate be brought out. Never happened. \n\nLamb meatballs with cucumber and tomato baba ganoush was the last savoury course. They were so salty I left them all and concentrated solely on the excellent mix of greens and herbs they were nested in. Another miss.\n\nThe meal ended with carrot cake which made me groan inwardly with disappointment when I saw it on the menu. Happily I was wrong. This proved to be light, creamy and delightful with a raisin puree on the side.  A heavy, hackneyed dessert blissfully reinvented. Yes!\n\nWould I go back? No. I wish Olly and Mr. D'Ambra well but with only 2 good-ish dishes out of the 6 that I had, as well as the awful acoustics, this was not a dinner outing I'd want to repeat."", 'Excellent excellent excellent service.  The presentation of the food was great.  We ordered the fried chicken and the lasagna.  The fried chicken was tasty but was a little bit over cooked to be honest.  The lasagna was delicious albeit the portion size could have been a tad bigger for the price.  Overall a good experience but nothing really to write home about.

The host said rice comes out unlimited, but the only tedious thing was having to constantly ask for it instead of them bringing it out as we finished or just bring out one super huge bowl. We are professional rice eaters in my family, and I don't think Han Dynasty was prepared for that. \n\nWe ordered the Scallion pancakes,Dan Dan Noodle,  Pepper Chicken , on Black Bean Style Fish, and one Garlic Tofu dish. All were solid, but the  Black Bean style fish was by far the best. The flavor was so sweet and spicy all at once and the fish was super moist. The cold Dan Dan noodles packed ALOT of spice and flavor as well. I wish I could take that sauce on the noodles home and pour it on everything...except cereal of course.\n\nAnyway, the food was a home run here and the price point was way lower than we all expected.

While looking through the other menu options online, I noticed the Three Cup Chicken in the specials section. I decided to try it. Based on the way the menu describes the items, I could not tell if this was going to come with rice or not. I assumed (and hoped) it would, and it did. You just never know with takeout these days!\n\nI scheduled it for a later pickup time, ran my errands, and stopped by a few minutes earlier than expected for my food.

Now before you consider wal - wait, don\'t. \n\nYour best bet to get to this heavenly, and yes, I mean HEAVENLY place (these donuts have officially provided me with an out of body experience) would be to drive your car and park on the sidewalk. Now with that being said, there\'s plenty of seats inside and outside of the place! Upon approaching the register, the woman working the counter gave us recommendations as I was looking into the gates of heaven. About eight donuts that are laid out inside of a small counter, with the workers constantly firing out more. \n\nExciting to say the least, I could feel the donuts calling me, ""Jimmy, we\'re HERE! What you\'ve been waiting so long for!"" They were right, this place was always on the corner of my mind while walking through New Orleans. My first time coming here, I absolutely had to get four of them. Now enough of me talking, let\'s get into the donuts themselves:\n\nBanana Cream Donut (5/5):\n\nI thought that the donut itself would be dry with regards to the numerous other donuts I\'ve eaten. Boy was I wrong! After the first bite, I could taste the glaze along with a hint of banana cream. Who knew there was a filling? I was expecting just a plain white cream filling, however, that wasn\'t the case! The guys hear at District Donuts put time into their donuts, and you can taste it! The added touch of the two banana pieces on top which actually were caramelized, made this treat twenty times better. Definitely the best one of the four so far! \n\nBoston Cream Pie (4.5/5):\n\nIdentical was how I would describe this one. Perfect yet identical. This donut wasn\'t a disappointment in any aspect. If you\'ve ever had a real Boston cream pie, this would be an exact replica. The cream inside is delicious but fluffy. Delicate, and not overpoweringly sweet. The chocolate glaze on top was moist and appealing on the pallet, almost like New Year\'s Eve fireworks (except you know, in your mouth).\n\nNow, the other two donuts I chose were toasted coconut and lemon raspberry. Both of those for my parents, because sharing is caring! Overall, just being able to see the staff at District Donuts working hard with regards to making their fresh donuts combined with the delicious quality of the donuts were enough for me to say that I will be back, but hungrier, for more donuts! Make this a mandatory place to visit on your way to New Orleans!', ""These D-O-N-U-T-S...OMG... All I can say is good thing I don't live by this place or I'd be in big trouble! This place was voted one of the TOP 10 donuts shops in America and I definitely know why! \n\nRecently I made a trip to New Orleans for Mardi Gras and District Donuts was on my radar all the way from Los Angeles! Um yeah... I can sniff out good donuts from hundreds of miles away! \n\n When I first walked in there was a line, but that didn't deter me. I was only worried they might run out of donuts and I was anxious to get my order in. The line looked pretty long but it only took me about 10 minutes to get through it. I was a overwhelmed because I wanted to try...um..all of them but I can only eat so much. When I finally got to the front of the line I found out my biggest nightmare had came true, they were sold out of the King cake donut, and that was the one I was really looking forward to trying! I asked them if I could pre-order it and wait to the side because they were cooking them, but they said they couldn't do that. I understood because there were so many people that wanted them that people pre-ordering could get confusing. \n\nIf you're not familiar what king cake is, it is a cake during Mardi Gras in New Orleans that is covered with different colors like pink, purple, and yellow. Inside they hide a baby. The tradition is, whoever finds the baby in the king cake has to buy the next king cake. These cakes are very popular during Mardi Gras. \n\nI ended up buying a box of donut. It included the Wedding cake donut, the NOLA, Red velvet, and the Spicy Maple Praline donuts. I also got a buttermilk drop (it's like a buttermilk biscuit that taste like a donut), a buttermilk biscuit and chocolate chip cookies. Don't judge, I shared all my goodies with a group of friends, that way I could taste everything. For full enjoyment I advise you buy all the above or you will be cheating yourself! \n\nWhile I was sitting in the store eating my donuts the owner came up and asked me if I wanted a king cake donut. He had heard the commotion I made at the counter about wanting a King Cake donut and my disappointment. I thought that was really awesome, and I didn't have to wait in line. Thank you Aaron! \n\nUnfortunately I was so focused on their donuts I missed out on getting some of their breakfast sandwiches and the Croquenuts (griddled donut sandwiches). They look so good that I could kick myself for not trying at least 3 of them each! \n\nMost importantly donut lovers, District Donuts  changes their donuts daily, which is a good and a bad thing. The good thing is there is a bunch of different kind of donuts that seem endless. The bad news is I don't live in New Orleans so I won't be able to try them all. If you live out here take advantage of how lucky you are. Here's a list of just a few of the donuts they have....\n\nPeanut butter and Jelly\nChunky monkey \nStrawberry basil \nPad Thai \nPeanut butter bacon\nSamoa\nBlack and gold\nChocolate milk\nStrawberry cheesecake \nMargarita \nCookie dough\nBanana foster \nCoffee cake \nFluffernutter\nHibiscus \nCaramel apple \nPassionate fruit \nSangria\nChocolate blackout donut\nStrawberry basil\nCarrot cake peeps \nChocolate glaze\nCinnamon glaze \nSpicy maple praline \nNola\nMorpheus \nStrawberry banana smoothie \nBoston cream\nMango pink peppercorn\nMint chocolate chip\nNutella mousse\nLemon ginger\nRum raisin \nPina colada\nCookies and milk\nBrownie batter \nChocolate chip\nCarrot cake\nBanana split \nSalted caramel \nVietnamese iced coffee\n\nI can't wait to come back and try them all!"", ""Exposed brick\n\nBeer on tap\n\nDoughnuts \n\nCold Brew Coffee\n\nT-shirts stuffed inside mason jars, Jelly, Pickles & Jalapeños for retail\n\nOysters\n\nShrimp Rangoon \n\nBLT\n\nBooth & bar seating \n\nAwesomely hip & helpful employees\n\n...are just a handful of the extraordinary things District has to offer.\n\nI couldn't help but try the Special Donut-la-mode which was a concoction consisting of a raised (unglazed) District donut sliced in half layered with lavender honey ice cream, graham cookie crumbled inside, the donut top replaced and drizzled with a mint sugar to form a donut ice sandwich supreme thingie! Taste so good I felt bad about it. I washed it down with their cold brew coffee and was ready for a nap. \n\nIf you're in the Garden District or not; it's imperative that you make it by this spot before leaving NOLA.

It's a refreshing change from your standard hotel ballrooms. For smaller meetings, there are several board rooms on the lower level, plus a gorgeous private dining room that would be perfect for a swanky bachelor or bachelorette party. Or a fancy business lunch, I suppose. \n\nThe rooftop lounge, Stratus, is also incredible. There is great indoor and outdoor space, separated by funky glass garage doors.

I'll probably try ABC again and if I do, I'll be sure to order the thin crust."", ""I've driven by this place a bunch of times, but only recently decided to check it out since I had zero desire to cook the other night (I feel like it's all I do lately!).\n\nThankfully, it was super easy to order on their website, and the pizza was ready just 15 minutes later. My boyfriend warned me this wasn't going to be NY style (my preferred pizza type), but more of a pan style... I was still surprised at how thick the crust was. The good news is, it may be thicker, but that doesn't mean it's doughy. The crust (and bottom) of the pizza still had a nice crunch to it. I did wish I had a garlic sauce to dip the crust in though.\n\nWe ordered half cheese, half pepperoni. I had briefly contemplated ordering extra cheese, but I'm glad I didn't -- it was pretty loaded with cheese as it was. The ingredients were fresh... I liked the sauce, and the cheese was great too. Oh, and the slices reheated very well in my air fryer (if you haven't tried that method yet for reheating pizza, you absolutely should).\n\nNow, I still prefer NY style, but I'd definitely keep this on the pizza rotation! I saw they have a pretty sizable Italian menu as well, so I will be back to try more of their food."", 'Finally checked out ABC after driving by quite a bit. The parking lot was packed on a Friday night. I was surprised by how much seating they have, and liked that most of the options are booths. Many families were inside chowing down on the inexpensive food. \n\nWe started with a pepperoni pizza as an appetizer (yeah, we\'re fat) just so everyone could get a slice and experience the restaurant\'s namesake offering. The pizza is good, although have others have commented it\'s not your typical New York style but rather ""Greek style"" which from what I can tell means a puffy crust and tons of cheese. \n\nFor dinner, everyone in my group went with an entree. I was tickled when reading the menu because it says all entrees come with MELTED CHEESE, salad (which never arrived), and garlic bread. We anxiously waited to see if we\'d each be presented with a side dish of melted cheese. When our food came out, we quickly realized what they meant -- each dish was cloaked in a thick blanket of cheese, making one dish indistinguishable from the next. I\'m not complaining since cheese is like oxygen to me, but if you\'re lactose intolerant you best not be ordering one of these dishes. \n\nMy chicken parm was served over spaghetti. It was satisfying and I ended up taking about 3/4 of it home. I tried my friend\'s eggplant rollatini which was also quite tasty. The garlic bread was not worth eating (but I did anyway, because... carbs.)\n\nThe decor in this place is incredibly random and unintentionally kitschy. Table placemats are covered in ads, which included ads for a bail bondsman, pawn shop and critter removal (which really gets your appetite working). There are framed posters throughout the restaurant which range from a knock off of the Last Supper (seriously, it wasn\'t even a print of the real thing just a completely different rendition with JC sitting on his own side of the table -- most likely eating Greek pizza but I didn\'t look close enough), a 300 movie poster, a map of the world, St Pete sunset, and many more. My motivation for coming back will most likely be to better inspect the entire poster collection. It was totally bizarre and wonderful. \n\nAlso weird is that you\'re given a ""check"" which is really just a take out menu with everything you ordered circled on it, and you\'re not given the total. I guess since it\'s so cheap no one minds this oversight. \n\nBut, alas, ABC gets 3 stars since I left full and with leftovers, I had a good laugh, and I didn\'t spend much money.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0

WTAF. My cat was pissed, and he doesn\'t even know that auricular thermometers are available. The clinic knows very well that animals dislike anal probing (duh), and, as a scientist, I recognize that while the anal method is vanishingly more accurate (see, e.g., https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23090330 (2012) (cats) and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3058653 (2011) (dogs)), it is unnecessary for routine checkups. Stop being cheap and buy some auricular thermometers. Would you like it if someone stuck a thermometer up your ass like it\'s 1957? (I\'m not posting any photos of my cat with a thermometer up his ass, but I was like, WTF.)\n\n[This addendum comes in response to your concern-trolling response. \n\nResponse of Karnin R. posted Oct. 30, 2019:\n10/30/2019 We always appreciate feedback from clients, Jeremy. \nWhile we understand rectal temperature taking is not always so comfortable for patients (and pet-parents to watch), rectal temperature measurement is still widely considered the gold standard for accuracy in cats and dogs within the veterinary industry and is backed up with recent research studies and reported in recent veterinary journal articles and petcare publications. It is not uncommon for a health concern to be discovered during even a ""routine checkup"" when the owner had not even been aware there was a problem, so it is essential we obtain the most accurate vitals during every patient visit. University Pet Clinic\'s team does our very best to keep both patients and pet-parents as comfortable during your visit as possible, while still providing the highest level of patient care.\nWe use digital rectal thermometers, which give results in just a few seconds and we use a lubricant on the thermometer to help minimize discomfort. Ear thermometers need to be \xa0inserted deeply into the ear canal to be close to the ear drum to get an accurate reading. Due to the many sizes and shapes of the cat and dog ear canal, digital ear temperatures aren\'t always precise. Plus, the presence of hair, wax, and debris in the ear canal (not to mention pet\'s trying to squirm away from or shake their head as the tip of the thermometer is deep in their ear)- all of these common things can affect accuracy. We have tried different types of ear thermometers over the years (we currently have one or two in our clinic for very specific situations), however, in our opinion many pets find ear thermometers to be more invasive and uncomfortable (sensitive ears, health problems in or around the ear, etc.) than rectal thermometers, plus we have found aural results to be inaccurate much of the time.\nJeremy, we hope this clarifies our choice in using a rectal thermometer during your cat\'s visit and improves your opinion of University Pet Clinic. Please feel free to reach out to me with any further questions or comments (Karin Schorr, Hospital Administrator, 520-795-7016).\nHere are just a few of the articles I found related to rectal vs ear and axillary thermometer results (some may show more evidence for dogs vs cats, however, the overall conclusions and recommendations are for both cats and dogs):\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1098 (2015)\nhttps://www.americanveterinarian.com/news/accuracy-of-auricular-axillary-and-rectal-thermometry (2018)\nhttps://jaaha.org/doi/10.5326/JAAHA-MS-6500 (2017)\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/taking-your-pets-temperature (2016) \n\nMy reply: Your response, while lengthy, merely propounds lame excuses and reinforces my point while ignoring the consent of pet owners. While I see your public profile @ https://universitypetclinic.com/about-us/our-pack, you seem to just be a homer--the founder\'s daughter--and lack even licensure as a veterinary technician, let alone as a veterinarian. What qualifies you to cite and discuss scientific articles? What are your credentials? Moreover, you have not earned the right to address me as Jeremy, nor are you smart enough to lie to me about science. The first article you cite merely makes my point that ""the anal method is vanishingly more accurate"" (see supra), on the order of 1°C. The second link leads to a magazine article making the same point (""the average discrepancy between readings was still 0.6°C""). The third link appears to lead to the source article discussed at the second link. The final link leads to an article containing no experimental data. The idea that a routine check-up needs temperature measured within 1°C, or that such a minor temperature fluctuation commonly alerts practitioners to health issues, is just nonsense. You claim, without evidence, that the clinic has tried auricular thermometers. At the end of the day, your response presumes, wrongly, that it is your choice. Under the law, pets are personal property, and I know you do not obtain consent prior to using anal thermometers because you know owners would object.]', ""I just received an email from University Pet Clinic asking for reviews on Yelp.

From the outside, Sefano's looks like a pizza restaurant that never got updated, but don't let that stop you from going inside.\n\nStefano's is a blending of a Greek / Italian restaurant combined with an American-style diner. There's a wide mix of choices on the menu as well as daily specials on the white board. The portions are massive, and the prices are very reasonable. During the week they're open from 11am - 9pm, but open by 7am on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for breakfast.\n\nThis is a seat-yourself kinda place, and you can choose from 4-top tables or 4-person booths around the restaurant. Your server will be there in a jiffy with the menu, to take your drink order, and to tell you about the daily specials. Stefano's is known for their Greek salads, and Greek specialties such as Mousaka, Dolmades, and Gyro Platters. They also feature homemade Italian favorites including Lasagna, Chicken Parmagiana and Chicken Alfredo.\n\nThe lunch menu has all of the traditional, authentic Greek specialties, along with soups, salads, sandwiches, wraps, paninis, burgers and sandwiches. At dinnertime you have all of the above plus traditional Italian meals, seafood, steaks, pork, chicken, and vegetarian dishes. Truly something for everyone.\n\nI ordered my lunch off of the Specials board and had two massive crab cakes (each was easily three times the size of any other crab cake that I've ever seen!).

I took home half of my dinner, so it was 2 full meals for $15!\n\nAs I looked around, everyone was receiving HUGE portions of food, and most all of us were leaving with to-go boxes.

I have been going to Stefano's for a few years and have never been disappointed. I always get their Greek salad. It is solid. It comes with all the fixins' and with potato salad tucked underneath. Although I have never sat down inside to eat, I have never had an issue with my order. Perhaps one day I may try some of the other items on the menu.

Had another shop respoke my wheel and install a new deraileur.  First ride out, not even 8 miles on it, Im dealing with major chain suck. Got home and noticed that at a certain point while coasting, that my free hub was sorta grabbing them releasing.  SO I took it back to fairwheel. They had it for a few days and finally told me they looked at it and the entire hub body was FUBAR and it would need to be replaced.  I am not sure, but I have a feeling that all the mechanical problems were due to something in the hub and my gut told me to take it somewhere else, once I talked to FW this last time.

To honor this, we present for you the home of the hand grenades in New Orleans.\n\nThese are seriously dangerous because they taste so much like juice!

You'll start to notice that the street seems a little wobbly and people seem fuzzy. \n\nI'd give this place a solid 4 stars if it weren't for the ambiance. A lot of the folks trying to get some hand grenades are pretty ratchet (which I can handle) but also really rude! Way to be a buzz kill.\n\nThis review is short and sweet, just like the amount of the night you'll remember.\n\nYou have been forewarned. Good luck! \n\nDATE TIP: This probably doesn't make the best first date spot, as everything will be a blur. Unless your date is boring and you need to escape! :("", 'A friend of mine who lives in Nola recommended this spot to me for a classic tourist experience and some hard liquor. Trying the hand grenade is apparently a staple when visiting New Orleans\' French Quarter drinking scene, and since I have a low tolerance I figured I could give this place a shot and probably not spend any money on drinking for the rest of the night.\n\nWe walked in around 9pm on a Friday night, and it was pretty packed, which was to be expected. There are a few Tropical Isle locations in the French Quarter, and I\'d assume most of them provide pretty much the same experience. There was live music playing and the place seemed very lively. \n\nWe approached the counter to order drinks, and I made the mistake of asking what was in a hand grenade. The bartender gave me a cheeky smile and said, ""can\'t tell you, but I can tell you it tastes good."" I appreciated the coyness for the brand\'s purpose, but when I clarified that I can\'t drink vodka (I\'m not allergic, but I tend to get pretty sick from it, plus it makes me a not-so-nice person in comparison to when I drink other alcohols), he still said, ""can\'t tell ya."" So we just kind of stared at each other for a second before my boyfriend recommended I just order a small hand grenade to try it instead of the large version. I understand the protection of the recipe for the brand\'s sake, but I was pretty disappointed that I couldn\'t know if there was vodka in it or not. I ended up looking up a recipe for something similar to a hand grenade online later on, which had vodka in it... but I still do not know if there\'s vodka in the ~actual~ hand grenade. \n\nWe sat down at a table near the door, and enjoyed our time there together. The energy was vibrant and the band played a lot of great rock and beachy songs. Plus, even though it was busy, it wasn\'t so busy where people were bumping into us or we couldn\'t walk around, which was nice. \n\nLuckily, the night ended up going well after that -- these drinks really do sneak up on you! They\'re truly very strong. Make sure you drink lots of water or your next morning will be a hangover nightmare.', ""The hand grenades are the bomb! Yes, it may be a little touristy but it's worth it. My husband and I went to NOLA for New Year's and stayed right across the street from Tropical Isle on Bourbon. It was great.

I didn't have their Shark Attack but I had their hand grenades. I had both on the rocks and frozen. Both were good but they say you get drunker with on the rocks. I had each on different days.

No! Here! No! Here!"" And we turned on to a little side street off Campbell, called Hedrick Avenue, and parked. Hedrick Avenue was full of potholes, but not under construction, and across the street was Prep & Pastry.\n\nTHE STORY \n\nWe walked in to a room, divided into two, with high ceilings, wood beams and stained concrete. There was a small wood podium. At the podium were two early 20\'s, adorable people: a man and a woman. The woman asked if we had reservations and said it would be a few minutes and then continued whispering to the young man. They both seemed not to notice they were at work and did little to help speed along the process or to see if they could make people more comfortable. There wasn\'t much room to stand, and it got uncomfortable as it got busier as people were crowed and the overflow pushed out to the parking lot.\n\nA few minutes turned into 20-30 minutes. I kept joking with my dad that I would be reporting this waiting mess on social media and my dad just politely smiled his, ""oh you kids and that social media stuff"" smile.\n\nWe were finally seated and the rest was very smooth. We ordered drinks; a berry mimosa and an Arnold Palmer and breakfast; eggs Benedict and Crab Melt. (see pics) Everything was terrific!\n\nOf course I had to hear the story of this restaurant. \n\nPREP & PASTRY: THE HISTORY \n\nPrep & Pastry opened in January 2014, taking over Amilia Grey\'s Café and Catering and is owned by Nathan Ares, William Meinke, Billy Kovacks, and Brian Pracko. Their goal was to raise the bar on breakfast fare, with a from scratch kitchen led by Jessie Bright, formerly from So-Ho and PY Steakhouse.\n\nPREP & PASTRY: THE MENU\n\nPrep & Pastry serves breakfast, brunch and lunch and the menu includes things like:\n\n~Tri-Tipped and scrambled egg sandwich served on a house made cheddar biscuit with jalapeño jam and topped with arugula\n\n~AM Relleno: a roasted pablano pepper stuffed with scrambled eggs, queso fresco, pico and native seeds/mole\n\nPrices average from $6-$8; the most expensive\n\nThe breakfast is duck confit for $11. \n\nCONCLUSION \n\n4/5 RECOMMEND \n\nOF NOTE \n\n*Parking is on the street if the parking lot is full. \n\n*Hours:\nMon - Fri: 7am - 3pm\nSat/Sun: 8am - 4pm\n\n*For more information:\nhttp://www.prepandpastry.com', ""Ever since I heard I could get cronuts in Tucson here, I had a singular focus, go to Prep and Pastry and get my hands on one. My first visit, I spotted spotted them and just fantasized how it would taste while waiting to be seated; it was a maple bacon variety and I was torn what to do as I like bacon but not so much on any old thing. They have pork or pork belly on several of their menu offering. It is THE ingredient to have for many modern eateries lately. The front area, has a nice display of fresh pastries that make me want to order everything and throw my diet out the window. Lucky for me it was lunch and the two left were snapped up. \nIn the mean time, I enjoyed a wonderful beet salad inside their open airy restaurant.  My friend ordered their tri tip sandwich and was unable to eat it since it was too fatty for her. So my next adventure to Prep and Pastry was for breakfast. This time I was able to order a cinnamon sugar cronut , which they call a doughsant. So if you too are on the same mission let me tell you I believe there is a difference. For one, the cronut I did have, had pastry cream. Their doughsants have icing on top and no cream or custard associated with it. My husband commented that it tasted like a churro; which for $4 bucks you can decide if you would like a tall doughnut shaped churro textured pastry. It's yummy but not croissant tasting.  I think adding the pastry cream would make it another level of wonderful.\nFor breakfast I have enjoyed their AM relleno, which is a roasted chile topped with a cooked egg and cheese mix, all on top of red spicy mole sauce( which comes from the Native Seed store). I loved the flavor profiles of this dish and it was a moderate portion of food; perfect for me. I've also tried their corn beef hash, which as much as I usually love corned beef, was a bit disappointing. The gnocchi that is served with it was out of this world fantastic!\n\nThey serve Exo coffee, which is roasted on 6th Street in downtown Tucson. WIN!\n\nI was lucky enough to be offered a sample of their new brioche chocolate chip french toast. It was served with a citrus whipped cream and maple syrup. I loved all three, but I would prefer vanilla or regular whipped cream with the chocolate chip bread. I think the citrus whipped cream would be excellent on a blueberry french toast, but that's just my two cents. The parking is a bit tricky since word of mouth is spreading and there was no parking in the lot my third visit and I had to park on the street. During the week, when it's not crowded it's a wonderful place to dine. When it's crowded it gets noisy fast. Also I would like to add, every trip I have had EXCELLENT service from the staff. Which makes all the difference."", ""Oh Prep & Pastry,  you've been open less than a week and Tucson clearly has a crush on you. I had to see what all the fuss was about... I went for breakfast this Saturday morning with my husband and baby, we were promptly seated although the place was bustling and mulled over the gourmet breakfast options. My husband went for the Biscuits & Gravy made with duck confit and I opted for the AM Rellano. Both were more gourmet versions of the homestyle dishes and seasoned impeccably. \n\nBefore leaving we also had to try the pastry part of Prep & Pastry. So I ordered the blueberry & earl grey tea scone. I was skeptical about tea IN my scone rather than with it but it blew my mind. All the warm mixture of flavors just like sipping tea with a scone was there. I can't believe I haven't had something like this before,  so familiar but so innovative! The tea makes the blueberries pop. Let's just say the scone didn't make it home,  or even out of the restaurant. \n\nPrep & Pastry you've won me over, I know it's true love.""]",0.42857142857142855,0.0,0.0,0.5714285714285714,0.0,1.0,30.0

(from Orlando) joined me for a superlative-laden sushi banquet at Toki Sushi on N. Dale Mabry in Carrollwood this past weekend.\n\nThe three of us are sushi fanatics -- we like our sushi pure, and not rolled up with a bunch of gunk inside and dripping with sickly sweet sauces. As a result we had been plotting an evening at a local sushi house to test the skills of the resident sushi master. I have been a loyal client of Toki Sushi for over ten years, and have become good friends with head chef, Chris, who was classically trained in Japan, and who brought his skills to the US about 40 years ago. With Chris\'s help we planned an evening of Omakase delights for the three of us to enjoy.\n\nAt the appointed time, I arrived and said ""Konichiwa, Itamae"" to Chris, which is the formal way of greeting the sushi master, and showing respect for his craft. The concept of Omakase is basically saying ""Chef\'s choice"", or more correctly ""We are putting our trust in you to deliver the best possible meal for us"". Since Chris and I had arranged for the Omakase meal in advance, he was able to order some special treats and to arrange very elegant preparations for us to enjoy.\n\nThe Omakase meal is served as a series of small plates where the tastes, textures, and sensual delights flow smoothly from one dish to the next. Chris asked if there was anything that we didn\'t like, and then set about placing the courses in front of us one at a time. I\'ve included photos for each course, but here are the descriptions:\n\n#1 - Octopus and Shrimp miso salad\n\n#2 - Tuna Tataki\n\n#3 - Squid with yuzu tobiko and Squid with uni\n\n#4 - Chutoro - Medium-fatty Tuna\n\n#5 - Marinated Sea Bass\n\n#6 - Seared Salmon Belly\n\n#8 - Mackarel Roll\n\n#9 - Uni and Firecracker (mixed with Octopus)\n\n#10 - Giant Clam\n\n#11 - Squid with wasabi tobiko and Albacore Tuna\n\n#12 - Sushi handroll with Eel and sliced Avocado\n\n12 courses of incredible deliciousness that we\'re still talking about. This was not an inexpensive meal - roughly $75 a piece, but if you truly love sushi then you owe it to yourself to try an Omakase meal sometime at the hands of a sushi master.\n\nChris entertained us with stories of his training in Japan, and we discussed techniques for cleaning and preparing the fish, as well as his amazing knife skills as he shaved wafer-thin slices of fish and rested them atop his carefully-crafted rice.\n\nThis was a spectacular evening with two great Yelp friends, and the wizardry of our chef.   Domo arigato, Itamae!', ""Toki Sushi is my go to place for Omakase, thank to Steve E's findings.\nI always make sure to call ahead with a reservation to find out when Omakase if being served during the week.  It is typically on weeknights and only when Tatsuo is available at the bar.  Excellent quality and about $75 per person is a steal for a special occasion.  Considering how much Tampa people pay for steaks around here, Toki sushi is a much more unique treat.\n\nThe chefs are actually Japanese, and most hail from Osaka.  Therefore, you will find takoyaki as a staple on the menu.\n\nWhen omakase is not available, I still mainly order nigiri or gunkanmaki.

The fatty tuna was delicious, the fish was high quality and you can definitely taste the difference between that and regular tuna. The shrimp was the best I have ever had, not cooked like your average sushi place, actually raw but not fishy at all. The shrimp head came along completely fried, and yes I ate all of that. The rest of the nigiri sushi and the sushi rolls were just as good, but the shrimp and fatty tuna really were the highlight.""]",0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,1.0,30.0

For my birthday a couple of weeks ago, my boyfriend got me a t-shirt with a picture of my two cats on it that says ""BEST FRIENDS"". One of these cats was adotped from Fairmount Pet. Everyone who works here is very nice and you can tell they are all animal lovers. I love the store\'s resident animals walking around and I appreciate their selection of goodies for cats (and dogs, even though I\'m not a dog owner). Also, they don\'t carry your standard pet food brands, only the good stuff.\n\nObviously, the best part of this store is their adoptions. One day on our way to Philly Flavors in May, admist a several week-long hunt for a companion cat for my first baby, my boyfriend and I stopped to look in window of Fairmount Pet. They had closed for the day already, and I had been in practically every day for about a week, but there were three new kitties in the window. Immediately, one caught my boyfriend\'s eye. ""I like that one."" I came back the next day and took him out of the cage and he stretched his little head up and touched his nose to mine. I WAS IN LOVE! Within a few days, I took him home and now the four of us are one happy family.\n\nI love that their adoptions have a good turn-around. It warms my heart. There are always cats being adopted out, including the occasional adult cat, which I appreciate. And I know that they are sure to give all of their animals good, warm homes. I think a visit to FPS is a must for any cat lover or pet owner. Adopt adopt adopt!', ""As a huge fan of cats, I love this place. My boyfriend and I wandered in one day while we were on a walk and after a few minutes of the little one-eyed kitty following us around and purring, that was it for me. \n\nBesides having loads of cute cats for sale and just generally living there, they also have a ton of supplies for kitties and puppies alike. They have a huge food section in the back with both wet and dry food -- and a good amount of the wet food is in really awesome, unusual flavors (Turducken, anyone?). The front is filled with everything from pet clothes to bowls, leashes, collars, toys, treats -- you name it, they've got it. \n\nIt's a tiny bit more expensive than your PetCo or PetSmart... but the way I see it, not only am I helping a local business, but I'm contributing to a place that obviously takes in kitties who are in need and I'm helping pay for their care. And to me, that's completely worth it -- my kitty is from the cold streets of Philly, and I know there are TONS more out there who need a good home. In my book, anyone who saves an animal is top notch. :)"", 'Having worked 5 doors down from Fairmount Pet Shoppe for the last few months, I have been passing by and seeing the oh-so-cute kitties in the windows for a while now. Today, I finally relented and went in. \n\nKnow this about me: I love cats. I have 8 cats. My mission in life is making them happy. The wife and I buy them the best food we can, groom them and keep them general pampered pusses. I am a cat person. \n\nSoooo it is with AWSOMENESS that finally a pet shop opened which caters more to cats than dogs. Let\'s face it- dogs get the glory. Every pet shop- from the small boutique to the overwhelming superstores- is about 60% dogs, 25& cats, 15% everything else. \n\nBut not Fairmount Pet Shoppe. This joint is 75% cats.

That better half of mine was already living in DC, so I took a day off from work to manage the moving logistics in Philadelphia. Elijah texted me 10 minutes before arriving (which was within the timeframe promised by Art). He and his associate Sam showed up with a massive truck, and immediately started loading boxes, bags and furniture once I showed them where everything was. They were done in barely more than half an hour. It was insane how easily they scooped up massive boxes and heavy furniture, as if they were small toys. (My 5-foot no-upper-body strength-having-self was completely grateful and relieved.) \nThree hours later I met Elijah and Sam at the unloading location (my new home) and they were as quick and skillful at handling that process as they had been with the packing. They actually ended up finishing over an hour early! Art had sent me an estimate the day before (you have the option of paying the full amount up front or half, with the next half due on moving day). My balance was adjusted accordingly. Important point to mention, ILTMI does not charge for the return trip hours, as most moving companies do, which is a huge advantage when you're moving three hours away from Philadelphia. \nOverall, my first experience with a professional moving company was fantastic, and I am so thankful to Art, Elijah and Sam for all their efforts. I should also note how wonderfully nice and personable both Elijah and Sam were throughout the whole process. I think they could tell how stressed out I was, and their calm mastery of the whole situation was exactly the reassurance I needed."", 'I booked this company on 6/29 to help me move on 7/30.

I texted again this am (day of move!) and finally was responded to at 8am. Circumstances were out of their control and they could not move me. Movers were supposed to arrive at 10.

I am trying to file a claim for damages caused by your movers to our property and house. Before I hired you we wrote via email and I asked if you were insured. You told me you had a policy with State Farm (email attached) . State Farm has not heard of your moving company nor the vehicle used for our move. They have heard of a ""Arthur Sudduth"" who is insured for a church group and has some mini buses and vans on the policy in the Philadelphia area. Could this be you ??!!  \n\nThe Better Business Bureau has no record of your moving company ??!!\n\nNot only were your movers 1 hour 45 mins late they had to leave to get supplies. They came back and lolligagged until 935 pm when the truck doors were finally closed. My belongings were then held hostage by you until  the next day when You had me agreed on a set amount of hours to pay in advance for the unloading of my belongings.  You told me you wouldn\'t release my belongings until I agreed on set amount. You had me pay for 3 hours of work when they unloaded my home in 2 hours. Why did it take so long to pack the truck ????\n \nI would like to add your movers were 2 hours late. Agreed arrival time 9am arrival time 11am and only after we threatened to call the police. \n\nYou also claimed I didn\'t give you prior notice of all my belongings being moved, please refer to past emails. Everything was listed. You did not place\nThem on my invoice and when I corrected you as to the list of missing items I was\nTold it would be fine. It was not fine. You tried to use this as a bargaining chip. Your company\'s Incompetence is overwhelming. \n\nNot only did I check in with you weekly prior to the move asking if ""Ebenezer"" would please work on my move and to make sure items like  packing cellophane would be at our move. \nIt didn\'t seem to matter how much preparation was put into the move your end didn\'t live up to the deal made. \nOne of the movers we had on the first day was so fed up he quit and didn\'t come back to finish the move the second day. \n\n\nWe have damages to our home and to our property. You have been ignoring me since you received payment and that is terrible business. \n\nAll I would like is to file a claim with the insurance company for damages your movers caused to our home and property. It\'s only right you give over the policy number to your insurance so this can be done. \nIf you do not allow us to file a claim I will happily take you to court for cost of damages to our home and property. You have put a lot of undue stress on a 6 month pregnant woman it\'s not right. You should have better ethics and take responsibility for your company and employees instead of evading the issue. \n\nPlease contact me with you  insurance policy Art Sudduth so this can taken care of and more time wasted can be avoided. \nI have already started a claim with PayPal for $500 of the $800 paid to be reversed and held in escrow until this can be resolved. \nPresently on my way downtown to try and find your company\'s licensing number though the municipal offices. Next step is to file paper work with the city for a small claims court.\nPlease let\'s avoid all of this and just allow me to file a claim with your insurance company.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,

I've been lucky enough to always attend these events when the weather is incredible with a beautiful view of City Park across the street from their wrap around balcony upstairs. The rooms are intimate without being pretentious or stuffy. \n\nThe staff has always been incredibly spot on for these events, greeting at the top of the stairs and taking any coats, knowing when a mimosa is the perfect thing to cure a hangover from the bridal party kickin' it up a notch the night before...I'm sure the application has something on it about the ability to read minds being *preferred. They also know just the right amount of sherry to add in their uh-mazing turtle soup. I've never ordered turtle soup 'cause the thought of it kinda skeezes me out, but ya'll...this turtle soup is so so good. It has a dark roux with bits of meat and a hint of sherry to complement, but not too smokey or heavy that you can't have other courses.  \n\nAt the recent luncheon I attended I was also able to enjoy their Louisiana Gulf Shrimp perfectly cooked and just the right amount of food for a lady's luncheon with tasso roasted heirloom potatoes, garlic spinach, and smoked tomato beurre blanc. Just enough to save room for their Bananas Foster Bread Pudding that I cleaned my plate of 'cause that would be a sin to let that go to waist..er, I mean waste. \n\nThey offer valet parking which I will partake in if my car isn't chin deep in event supplies, balled up receipts, and empty Zapp's potato chip bags. Like I said these events are top notch, 5 stars. The reason I left off a star (though they're really like a 4.5) is because I recently went after a special event because there was a post-event cocktail that they were serving. After having spent a pretty penny on the event ticket, I was hoping to keep the party going with an affordable cocktail but the specialty cocktail was around $13 which was a little pricey for me to enjoy late into the night. In terms of their regular menu, this is very much within the range of the company that would dine here, just a little pricey for me. \n\nEnter the Happy Hour! I will definitely have to get in there for their Happy Hour Tues-Thursday 5 -7pm ($5 cocktails/wine/spirits/$ 4 craft beers $2 domestic) with some of their appetizers that look incredibly delectable including ya-ka-mein and cobia crudo.

We had 6:15pm reservations, but arrived at 6:00pm and explained that we would like to sit in the bar area to have a predinnner drink. His response, ""Well all of my tables are reserved in the bar area, but you can sit at the bar."" Okaayy then, that\'s what we we\'re going to do anyway?? So we enter the bar area to find the small bar only had 2 available seats not next to each other and there were three of us. So, since we were not permitted to sit at any of the five empty but reserved tables in the bar, we kind of awkwardly meandered back over to the host\'s stand to let him know we would just like to be seated. His response, ""Yeah, it\'s gonna be more like 6:15 in this pretentious voice (mind you the restaurant was empty). Our faces must have spoke a thousand words because someone else came overand we were immediately sat. \n\nWith all that weirdness out of the way we actually had a nice dinner, well apps I should say. Ralph\'s menu is set up of all small plates with maybe 2-3 choices that of which you can upgrade to a meal-sized portion. Their special was choose 3 different small plates (some choices included up charges) and a glass of wine for $33.00. Food portions are very small. \n\nFood was underwhelming. Nothing we had blew us away. The presentation of the food was really nice (see pics below).

Here's why: \n\nVIBE: This is a cute little spot in Hyde Park that has a classic coffee shop feel. You can instantly smell the amazing coffee as soon as you walk up to the door. The cute umbrella tables outside make you want to sit and enjoy your morning sipping on coffee.\n\nSET-UP: When you walk in there is a shelf with items that you can purchase such as coffee grounds and other merch. Then you walk up to the bar which takes up most of the space and order. Then the barista makes your drink and calls you by name. Pretty much just like any other coffee spot. But, there isn't a ton of seating so either plan to take it to go or try to get there when it isn't as busy.\n\nWHAT DID YOU DRINK: I ordered an iced vanilla latte with whole milk. I'm not big into the other kinds of milk and when I try a new coffee spot for the first time I often op with whole milk the first time then switch it up if I like it.\n\nWHAT DID YA THINK: To be honest, it was really good! The baristas are really nice and make great coffee. I always see them cleaning up the stations after each coffee made. This was really comforting because you could see that they took cleanliness into consideration. I also liked that this coffee bar was not closed off with half panels of glass. You could clearly see everything that the baristas were doing. \n\nTIPS:\n-This tastes the best after a killer spin class next door. Saturday morning workout and then an iced coffee after hits different. \n-There is more than one location. So if you aren't in the Hyde Park Area no worries, check out the other spots!\n-While they have paper straws which is a step in the right direction, bring a reusable one. Your coffee will look cooler and you'll look cooler knowing you're making a tiny impact."", ""It's Buddy Brew - how can you not like them? I'll give you some reasons why it's one of my favorites and a hotspot for me!\n\n\n1.) Contactless pickup or delivery by putting in your order via their app. During the pandemic, it's an extra layer of protection. The app. tracks and rewards you for all your visits with a promo of $5 off your first order.\n\n2.) They have many locations for coffee addicts. Also, local is where it's at and it's certainly better than Starbucks - no question about that! I have been to Buddy Brew on Kennedy and inside Oxford Exchange (my fav. location by far w/bogo deals during the weekday [closed for now], but not Park Tower, which they opened earlier this yr.\n\n3.) The coffee isn't bitter at all. The espresso and milk ratio is perfection before your eyes and tastebuds. I went with a Large Iced Caramel Latte. I also didn't get any sleep since I drank it at 5:30pm - it's potent and caffeine laden! The caramel was on the bottom, so recommend you use a stirrer to mix in all the goodness. My hubs Vanilla Latte (hot) turned out to be sweeter than he likes, so for the future I recommend you ask for light additions of syrups.\n\n4.) The service tops it off for me. Even during this very difficult time, the barista was super friendly and working fast to crank out orders. This certaintly doesn't go unnoticed for me."", 'This Buddy Brew location in Hyde Park Village is great for a quick stop after a stroll through the shops. \n\nThe coffee is great and they have a nice selection of food and treat options including Salted Carmel Cheesecake and assorted macaroons!

At the time I told her that there was an area in my upper right back of my mouth which shouldn't be cleaned but at some point during the cleaning I thought she was getting incredibly close to that area so I motioned to stop and at that point something fell out in my hand which I had felt in my mouth right before then and I didn't know if it was part of the tooth or the bonding of that tooth. Then she said she'd have to take an x-ray and go get the dentist who was Dr Parikh. He wanted to do an extraction of the tooth right then and of course I refused and said that it should be put back the way it was which was bonded together and he said he could not do that until today. So I had to commute from Exton which is where I'm staying with my friend as we're traveling through the area. I would have to say at this point that I agree with a reviewer further on in the Yelp reviews saying that this man is a bit like a used car salesman. We exchanged niceties and we did agree on politics but that doesn't mean anything as far as how he treated me as a patient. In  Dentistry IQ which I recently read it says a red flag of a dentist is a dentist who consistently puts down the dentists that a patient has gone to prior to him or her and that is what he did in this case and it's disrespectful of me and he sets himself up for a lawsuit. My lawyer actually told me that I shouldn't have to pay any more than what I was supposed to pay originally which was the $100 for the cleaning and nothing else but I feel like I perhaps should pay for the X-ray but nothing else past that. Apparently there is another dental office in the same building and I ran into a woman in the elevator who said she'd been going there for 12 years. \nPhiladelphia Dentistry has pretty good reviews. Perhaps consider going there instead. But if you do need cosmetic work make sure you follow the advice of Dentistry IQ which is to look at the before and after pictures of any cosmetic dentist that you consider or ultimately go to for your own safety. Dr. Pateh actually had the audacity to ask me if the prior dentists I was going to were legitimate and if they had their credentials on the walls of their lobby. I said I noticed his credentials were not in the lobby.  He said they were behind the reception area. He disrespected and discounted the work I had done in Mexico as well as all the other work I've had done which is more than one red flag. the hygienist yesterday use the term after she made her mistake that I was under supervised negligence.

In the end we decided we rather support local and the Kobe nearest to us has a less than four star rating - wow am I getting elitist on where I eat. I'm actually glad we chose here, because it was pretty empty so we didn't have to worry about my son's crazy antics and the food was good!\n\nFOOD - I always worry that hibachi will be too greasy. Not here! My husband got noodles, fried rice, vegetables, shrimp and steak. All of it was delicious. I really enjoyed the noodles. \n\nI ended up going with the Salmon Sushi Entree. I really enjoy that they have these combinations of sushi to order - theres a whole page of it. It was about $20 for a salmon roll, spicy salmon roll, and three pieces of salmon sushi. I feel like that combination a la carte would be less than $20, but I didn't get a chance to price it out. It is a little on the pricier side, but every piece of sushi was delicious.  The salmon tasted fresh and not fishy. \n\nWe started with shrimp shumai steamed. Honestly, it seemed to me like the type you could get frozen at the Asian market. I didn't dislike it, but I wouldn't get it again. \n\nATMOSPHERE - from the outside this place looks pretty run down. It's in a random location as kind of close to the movie theater, but not walking distance. I guess it is a testament to the food that it has survived so far. Inside it is much nicer. It is split between the sushi side and the hibachi side. Both sides are pretty large. On a Monday night there were only a couple tables occupied.\n\nSERVICE - It is slow.

Really, I could go here every day."", ""A worthwhile destination, even if you are not from the neighborhood.\n\nI lived at 48th & Hazel back in my art school days which was before the area was cutely named 'Cedar Park' and when Baltimore Ave. did not have very much to offer in the way of ethnic food, other than Lucky's Chinese Take Out, which is still in business after 37 years-possibly under new management. \n\nAfter a too long stint on the West coast, I moved back to Philly in 2015. I had been longing to see my old West Philly neighborhood again. In the back of my mind I was also on the look out for some decent, non trendy, authentic Thai food but I never expected to find it here.\n\nLaotian food is damn good food, somewhat along the lines of Thai cuisine but subtler. My dining companion and I found parking on a side street and as we crossed Baltimore and headed towards Vientiane, I was giddy with memories and pleased to see this old street looking better than the last time I waited on the corner for the trolley to take me to art school in Center City.\n\nThis place is cash only and byob. \n\nFirst impressions-one was how utterly delicious the place smelled when we walked in. I wanted to go from table to table, asking the diners what they thought the best thing on the menu was. Second was the unfeigned courtesy. We got seated right away and were watered and menued up with no waiting. Everything looked so good. Wonderful to see that sticky rice could be had with entrees.\n\nWe started with fried spring rolls and Yum Salad with shrimp. Excellent! Smart, crisp flavors and fresh, well handled food. Someone in the kitchen absolutely cared about what they are sending out to diners. The crowd was mixed; Caucasian students, married, straight 20 somethings, elegant looking mixed race couples, beautiful Rasta boys, professors, seniors-all the casual, natural and unstudied diversity that made me ache for Phillly when I lived elsewhere. This is not a big place and it can be loud, bit it's an easy, happy, comfortable kind of raucousness that washes over you and pulls you in, making you feel like part of an all embracing, wonderful party.\n\nService was polite and pleasant. Entrees were more than ample. My companion had green curry with tofu that she raved about while I had the Lao pork sausages-three fat, juicy ones with a side of sticky rice, lick your fingers dipping sauce and a mound of vegetables which were forgettable but fresh. I didn't care because I wanted to reserve my appetite so I could do the sausages justice. Time slowed as it does when one is having a really exceptional meal. Between the audaciously fine food and the people watching, I was in heaven. We were not rushed or pushed to order more than we already had. \n\nWe finally finished with Thai iced tea and the tempura fried banana (cliched but delicious). As we wound up our repast, we were making future plans to come back for lunch, and for dinner again and then for lunch and...who knows, maybe I'd even head down the block to get something to go from Lucky's for old times sake...\n\nRemember-cash only and bring your appetite.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

On my drive there, I went through various neighborhoods, road constructions, and even smaller food stores nearby. On my arrival, the place was hidden amongst a long narrow street with cars parked left and right. If you\'re looking for some excellent parking, park at the CVS Pharmacy right next to the place, and you\'ll be able to enjoy a short walk there!\n\nAnyways, let\'s move on to the actual review! Well, I wanted the best bang for my buck, so I went for the six scoop (mini-sampler) for only $7.00 FLAT! Cash only! Not really too big of a deal for me, and I even left a tip seeing as the woman at the counter provided me with excellent customer service in regards to explaining the various items on the menu to me and offering samplers along the way! \n\nAfter shuffling through all the flavors, I narrowed it down to these six:\n\nHoney Lavender: \nRating: 4.2/5\nThe honey lavender wasn\'t too bad, as with a majority of their ice cream, this one was really smooth. Best enjoyed eaten inside, because if you\'re going for a six scoop, the heat\'s going to melt your ice cream pretty quickly and soon enough you\'ll have ice cream soup! The flavor was definitely on point, it wasn\'t heavy, but rather faint. Additionally, it wasn\'t too sweet, but in between, you\'d be able to taste the lavender more than anything else!\n\nCreole Cream Cheese:\nRating: 4/5\nWhenever you get the ice cream, there will be small pieces of cream cheese inside, not an overload of it! That\'s just the way I like it! The name for me was somewhat off putting in that I\'m not a big fan of cream cheese, but at least the ice cream was delicious. The bits and pieces of cream cheese along the way definitely made the experience worthwhile, so why not give this one a try?!\n\nSalted Caramel: \nRating: 3.5/5\nOne thing that I NEED, and I mean, absolutely NEED in my salted caramel ice cream, is the flavor and color! The salted caramel at the Creole Creamery was whitish, not the usual lightish brown I\'m used to in terms of most ice cream shops. The caramel taste was light, but I didn\'t receive any of the ""salted"" flavor in the ice cream which I\'ve previously received at other ice cream locations on the West coast. Overall, it could use more color, texture, and flavor.\n\nBanana\'s Foster:\nRating: 4.75/5\nWhat I loved about this particular flavor is the bits and pieces of small caramel and banana present in each bite I took. A hearty banana\'s foster on a hot day like this one is all I\'d ever need to cheer me up! Not much to say about this flavor besides the fact that it tasted EXACTLY like the actual dessert, which made me smile a bit on the inside. \n\nCafe Au Lait:\nRating: 4.5/5\nI\'m a HUGE coffee enthusiast, so trying this flavor was mandatory! The ice cream was pretty amazing, it tasted just like a freshly brewed cup of Cafe Au Lait which actually made my tastebuds fall in love with this particular scoop of ice cream. The sweetness of the ice cream wasn\'t overpowering, but just right! \n\nPistachio: \nRating: 3.5/5\nPistachio? Sort of difficult to pull off, but they got it sort of right. The ice cream\'s sort of light green, but the taste is smooth and creamy, more light then anything. \n\nIn conclusion, my only regret is that I was on a timed schedule and didn\'t have enough time to sit outside the entire time to enjoy the ice cream to the full extent! If you ever have extra time, this is the perfect place to take your close friends, family, girlfriend, etc. The customer service is extremely nice, and the employees are always attentive to your needs!

As I waited on my order, I set my expectations for outcome accordingly.  That said, expectations were exceeded. \n\nThe two folks working in the kiosk / shack were very friendly and efficient and the gyro my husband and I ordered was pretty darned good.  I\'m no expert on the specialty (on the subject of Italian food I could have a far more informed opinion) and I\'m not really even sure I know how to eat a gyro properly.  But the Super Veggie Patty gyro, made with all the fixins\' of fresh tomato, lettuce, spicy sauce (which is sricacha, I\'m pretty sure), pepperoncini, feta, kalamata, hummus, avocado slices and tzatziki was nicely wrapped and boxed up to go (there is no seating here, it is a drive through) and made a nice \'splitsie\' dinner at home.\n\nWhen I asked about the gyro meat offered on all the options but those which are veggie, I was told it is made of a lamb and beef blend.  We were hoping for an all lamb option, (a meat we eat), instead of beef (a meat we don\'t eat) being included in all.  But we choose vegetarian options most of the time anyway and we were happy to see a single one, ""Veggie Patty Pita"", on the menu.\n\n""Is the veggie patty like a felafal?"", we asked.\n\n""I don\'t know what that is"", said the nice young man behind the window, ""but I think this one has chickpeas in it.""\n\nSeriously.\n\nFor the record, it was like a flat falafel.\n\nWhen we asked if we could get the ""Veggie Pita"" that came with all the fixin\'s like a deluxe gyro it was the nice young woman who said while no longer on the menu as it once had been, we could order and they could make a Super Veggie Patty Gyro that came with everything.\n\nAnd that is the story of how we came to enjoy our tasty take out dinner.  Big enough to feed two lighter eaters for under nine bucks.  \n\nWould we go back for take out here?  You bet.  And order the same thing again?  Happily.\n\nBe aware ""their chain shows"" in some items and this is a drive through.  But if you\'re a gyro afficiando (we\'re not there yet), we imagine this is a very good place to be.\n\nTHIS N THAT:\n1) Parking:  If you want to eat at the little picnic table or two at outside the shack, there is parking at the lot across the way.', ""The Gyro Shack rocks it.\n\nI enjoy both their Deluxe Chicken Gyro and their Greek Salad Pita.  \n\nAlways fresh.\n\nAlways ample.\n\nAlways delicious.\n\nI've also ordered and enjoyed their hummus with pita bread.  A word to the wise, though--the serving size is huge.  They give you a good 12 or so ounces of hummus.  We enjoyed it for days (definitely not complaining!).  The prices are amazing.  Three of us each got a gyro, and shared the hummus side for less than $20!\n\nAlso?  The service is Michael Phelps in the pool fast.  Which is to say, they deserve several Olympic medals for the speed of service (especially considering how fresh and wonderful everything they're serving is).  You drive up, order, and a couple short minutes later you're driving away, food in hand.  I'll take The Gyro Shack over many other forms of fast food any day of the week.\n\nGet to it!"", ""What's super sad about this place is the new owners don't seem to understand what made it great. For what it WAS I'd give it 5 stars, happy fast service, great food! They have the best gyros, certainly the best in Boise. The Z is delicious and the super is huge and excellent every time! Lamb, bacon, pita bread and veggies are always fresh and on point. What made it popular was that it was talked about by everyone, and I mean everyone, how it was such a great deal. A place with low overhead that built its loyal clients by actually passing savings along to them. I like the new menu concept simplified with pictures and all. The new owners raised the prices of all the gyros and specials etc. I think the sides are all the same but .50 for a couple tomato slices or peppers is overpriced anyway.\n\nOverall it's still delicious and I'll come back for sure, just not as often. You used to be able to feed two people for about $10-12, now it's over $14-17. I get it, just a few bucks but that's a 30-40 percent increase. I guess I just think it's too bad the prices are the same as a if they had a restaurant overhead. Mazzah down the street is $2 less for nearly the same gyro, and way more overhead, no kidding.\n\nBottom line: still great flavor and quality, but it seems the new ownership has put price ahead of its loyal customer base.

At first glance you might be inclined to think that this is one of those creepy rub and tugs with the strangely blacked out windows and sticky floors.\n\nBoy was I wrong.  I'm not a Korean bath house virgin but will admit that I have been to some larger venues so wasn't completely sure what to expect here.\n\nLet me start off by saying that the hospitality here was amaze-a-balls!   Generally when I visit Korean bath houses/restaurants/grocery stores---hospitality is definitely not the first word that comes to mind----but that mind set was very different here.  Took a visit here with my brother.  We were greeted upon entry.  The woman checking us in was very pleasant and asked if it was our first time.  We let her know it was our first visit to this location and she gave us all the details.\n\nShoes go in the first set of locker cubbies.  Then your clothing belongings go in the second set of lockers.  Wet area was on the small side, there is one hot whirlpool and one cold whirlpool.  The shower area was ample and there was a steam room.  I pretty much had the place to myself so that was pretty cool.  \n\nThere are two heated treatment rooms, salt room and clay room--each having different properties that would help me work on my health.  The rooms were on the warmer side but I'm thinking that's to help the elements penetrate your body---or something to that affect.  Whatever it was----it definitely helped clear up my sinuses!  \n\nThey have a few relaxation rooms (basically a nice place to just lay down and chill/sleep)  They offer a variety of treatments---body scrubs, facials, massages (I didn't partake in any but will try next time around).\n\nOf course as we're roaming back and forth between the sauna rooms, watching some tv----we start to get hungry------tada! There is a food area----it was about 10pm and the lights were off----my stomach was telling me otherwise-----as we walked around, found a gentlemen carrying some items to the kitchen, so of course we decided to follow him while trying not to look like we were stalking the Korean food goodies----when I asked him what time the food area normally closed he said it was still open and was more than happy to cook up some dishes.\n\nScore!\n\nWe had the mandu dumplings, seafood pancake, and kim chae jagae---wowza!!!  The portions were pretty big and the food was very good.  Late night dining that definitely hit the spot!  As a bonus we got a plate of pineapple and sliced apples to close off our meal.   \n\nWe had an awesomely non-sketchy experience!!!! Hooray for the little things in life."", 'Well like to start off by saying this place is amazing! When we first arrived just like everyone else I was thinking it looked a little sketchy, but as soon as we walked in the door my wife and I were greeted by the Korean woman who was so friendly it scared me. She went through the ""menu"" and informed us of everything that was going to happen.\n\nWe opted for the gold package since it was her first time and was instructed to go to separate locker rooms so that we can strip down and put on our spa clothes. After that we immediately met up for late dinner in the full restaurant at the back of the spa.\n\nThe food was OK I guess I would say so so unless you\'re into Korean food. What we ordered was pretty decent especially the teriyaki chicken. The red wine was served cold but as soon as I informed him he switched it out for some room temperature red. \n\nAfter dinner we each went our separate ways for our body scrub And boy did they scrub! The lady who was working on me pointed out several times a pile of dead skin that I did not know I had. She worked on me for at least one hour including bathing me in some type of milky oil and when I came out I felt like a newborn baby.\n\nI did my time in the hot tub and the cold tub as well as the steam sauna but was eager to meet up with my wife again in the community room.\n\nI think it is important to point out that while the lady was doing my body scrub I was provided with a pair of swimming shorts which I actually was able to wear the entire time I was in the wet area. There were a few other people there for other guys that I counted on a late Saturday night and a lot of Asian women in the community area.\n\nI have been fighting sinus congestion and nasal congestion for a couple weeks but after five minutes in the salt Sama I noticed I could breathe easier and my sinuses are clear. I should have stayed in the soul so the longer but I needed to go. We actually signed up for couples massage but change my mind after I see my hot wife in the sauna LOL. \n\nWe hailed an Uber and made it home just in time to relieve the babysitter before we had our adult time. \n\nShe has already made arrangements to take her neighbor friend back to the spa in a couple of days LOL\n\nThis is truly a gem hidden in Tampa Bay! I will definitely be back. I highly recommend this location to anyone looking for something out of the ordinary and extremely relaxing, refreshing, and rejuvenating!\n\nAlso this place was as ""anti-sexual oriented"" as Walmart. Families are welcome and no one should fear being approached or propositioned or made to feel uncomfortable here. 100% safe in my opinion', ""If you're a fan of Korean spas and have visited more than one, then there's a good chance that you'll be disappointed here. I feel bad leaving a less than amazing review, because the people truly were lovely, and spa-wise it was okay for the area, but if you've been to any other Korean spa, this might seem like a let down.\n\nFirst, the size. The check-in area is like any other, not big, not small, and there process is much the same you'll find anywhere else. Now, when you get into the actual spa, that's where things get a little...interesting.\n\nIt's very small in the spa. Extremely small, actually. There is ONE hot tub. One. And it didn't have jets. There is also one cold tub. There is a small steam room (which was nice and hot, I must say) where you have to turn on the steam, it doesn't just stay on. And there are two small banks of shower areas (which honestly need to be cleaned), and a small massage area. That's it. There is no sauna, there is no place to sit and relax in the spa, and there are no other hot tubs.\n\nAgain, if you're used to other Korean spas, where there is usually a selection of hot tubs and a sauna and some chairs for lounging, be aware that you won't get those things here.\n\nHowever, the rest of the spa was a nice size. The common areas are as spacious as you'll find in all but the biggest spas, as is the eating area. Okay, I have to take a minute to talk about the food. There seems to be one older gentleman working there who makes the food. He shops locally and brings in fresh food twice a day. That food? Was LIT. It was amazing, and I've eaten in every Korean spa I've ever been in, from L.A. to Washington state. This man's food was fantastic. Treat yo'self.\n\nThe salt room in the common area was really quite nice, and just like any other. It was nice and hot, and just what I needed. The clay room was noticeably less hot, but it's nice to have a choice. There was also an ice room.\n\nSo, if you're used to Korean spas, don't go expecting what you've experienced elsewhere. It seems that they're the only one in the area, so hopefully they build a big clientele that allows them to expand!\n\nBut seriously, try that food.""]",0.5,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,1.0,30.0

We were in Nola visiting his brother and therefore unfamiliar with the spas. He also wanted one and after calling around the day of, this is where we ended up. He said his was good but not great, he received his from a nice young girl. I on the other had had the most awkward and unprofessional, downright creepy experience of my life. The appt. was for 5 and like another reviewer they tried to get us to come in at 4:30 with a phone call. We declined. We arrived at five and were led upstairs by a man and a woman. The woman was in scrubs and clearly a masseuse. The man was a average build Asian man in dress type clothes, dress shoes, and a pager on his belt who I assessed to be the owner. We were led to the rooms and to my surprise the owner told me to disrobe and he'd be back. Taken aback I stammered that I'd like him to focus on my neck and shoulders as they were sore. I have had massages before by a male masseuse, but I was always asked before I booked the appointment if I was comfortable with a male, and they were always very obviously massage therapists. The situation I found myself in was totally unprofessional. I was not asked if I minded a male and I am positive he was not a massage therapists. In fact it was totally messed up that the legit female masseuse worked on my boyfriend while I was stuck with the skeevy owner. There I was lying naked under the thinnest sheet, not even a nice thick one that is used in nice spas but a cheap thin sheet. I had questions about the legitimacy of the whole production before he began the massage but the minute he started I knew there was no way he was a licensed massage therapist. He was awkward and totally unskilled, he just kept running his hands up and down my back. Mind you putting no pressure on me, it could have been a caress. His belt buckle (at least that's what I kept telling myself) kept pressing into my head. His crotch grazed my hands on multiple occasions. I was as rigid as could be thinking about how disgusting and uncomfortable the scenario I was in actually was. If you recall I specifically asked for work on my neck and shoulders, they were totally neglected. After a few minutes in I thought I would just tell him I only want a half an hour massage. I don't know why I was so afraid to speak up, I should have ended it. The worst parts where when he would lift the sheet to put my arm back under, he lifted it very high, far higher than was necessary I feel to get a flash of my rear. Also, when he was massaging my legs his hands kept grazing my rear. The only part I actually could almost relax for was at the end when he was doing my feet. But by then he was making conversation the first question was about my hair color!?! Then he went on about football actually engaging me in a conversation about a sport I have zero interest in, making the only possible enjoyable part of the massage an utter let down. To add total insult to injury, the massage cost 90 dollars (and I'll be darned we tipped him 10!! The curse of being a polite mid-westerner by birth) I speculate when my boyfriend called to make the appt. the accepted both of us, with only one masseuse on staff, so the owner decided to fill in. The guy is an utter pervert and the spa is unethical and creepy. Unless you want to feel like he should have paid you for the privilege of groping your body, DO NOT GO HERE. In fact, the more I think about it the more I am so mad I didn't make a complaint."", 'My fiance wanted to get a massage and never has the time. He works long hours and often on the weekends. So he called me from work on a Friday afternoon and said ""Babe I\'m off tomorrow, schedule us a massage."" Needless to say, at the last minute no one had anything open. I called around to a lot of places. \n\nSo I stumbled across Riverside online and most of the reviews were good. Lucky for us they had a 5pm opening for 2 people. Now I had asked for a couples massage but the pleasant lady on the phone said that it really wouldn\'t be a couples massage cuz we\'d be in separate room. I thought okay fine. \n\nSo the day of our appointment, a man called to confirm and asked me if I can come in early at 4 instead of 5...I was pretty busy so I said I would try but dont really count on it. So around 4:30 the man called again and asked if we were on our way....my fiance answered the phone and told him yea we\'re coming. then the man said we were ""supposed"" to be there at 4pm. NOT. So of course I\'m starting to get a little antsy cuz I\'m thinking they\'re trying to rush us or they\'re going to try to shorten our massage. \n\nWell we finally make it. And it looks like a nail shop. The place isn\'t fancy at all. But it is neat and clean. I noticed that they didn\'t have us fill out any paperwork (usually with spas they have just a small questionnaire about your health). So they escort us upstairs via elevator and we go in our separate rooms. \n\nNow I\'m used to calm, quite and relaxing when getting a massage but the lady I had was a chatty Kathy. She gave a good massage,,but she wouldn\'t shut up. Her name was Leila, and while miss girl worked wonders with those hands and stones, I still really didn\'t enjoy it fully because she talked to damn much. And then she talked about the owners.

There wasn't much of a crowd, so there wasn't much of a wait. When my food came out, I was delighted at how crispy the chicken looked. There was seriously a thick layer of crust on the breast, the likes of which I rarely see. As I dug into the chicken, I noticed that it was perfectly cooked to tender perfection. The meat fell off of the bone and there was plenty of it.  The skin was light and crispy and practically melted in my mouth.  My only real complaint with the chicken was that there was no spice added to it. I like my fried chicken to have a bit of a kick (I am a Southern girl, after all) and this chicken had no kick at all. It was without a kick.\n\nAlso, the potato salad tasted store bought. I apologize right now if it wasn't. Maybe I am super picky when it comes to potato salad, because I've had the homemade stuff. While it was good, I think I will opt for the mashed potatoes next time.  \n\nAll in all, for a little over $6, my meal was good and I enjoyed it, I left Chubbie's satisfied and promising myself that I would eat healthy for the rest of the week.

I'm surprised in today's world of technology they haven't decided to offer online booking, it would improve the customer experience. I find their text system hit or miss, there have been times I never receive a response and end up calling to book, which defeats the purpose.\n\nWhen arriving for an appointment, the lobby is well decorated with snacks and retail items for purchase. They now have a sign at the desk asking you to sign in, but it's a bit odd seeing 1 - 2 receptionists who are  sitting there, not really welcoming you or adding to your visit. For example, the sheet asks for your technician's name, but I rarely know when I book. I leave it blank, and there's no acknowledgment of whether I'm actually signed in. You then take a seat and sit there until your Waxer calls your name (which you wouldn't know as a first time guest.)\n\nThis is where the experience goes from 3.5/4 stars to 3, your technician tells you which room to step in...and that's it. There's no instructions on whether to disrobe, how much, where to put your clothing/purse, when the tech will be in, how to lie or even a modesty cover. So you're left awkwardly taking your bottoms off and holding them over your private parts until someone knocks and comes in.\n\nThe waxing experience widely varies based on the tech. I've had completely silent appointments, devoid of direction or conversation, and people who distracted me from pain with their pleasant personalities. Some seem like amateurs, leaving tons of hair, agitation and bleeding; others get everything they can. The varying personalities could be solved by adding a white noise machine or sound system with music (preference for spa sounds) to each room to create a better ambience.\n\nIt's clear they work under time constraints, but it's even more uncomfortable at the end. You're asked if almond oil is okay, a tiny bit is slathered on your aching hoo-ha, then they ask if you want a beverage and leave the room. Prior to leaving the room, they could really benefit from discussing aftercare options since they sell a bunch in the lobby. I'm not sure about other people, but I don't want to talk about the merits of vaginal exfoliation at the public checkout desk. There's usually a pile of discarded hairy strips and an open trash can full of other people's hair strips. I'd strongly encourage management to implement a discard policy (throw strips away while working,) and invest in a closed top can with a foot pedal. If would facilitate a feeling of cleanliness. \n\nWhen leaving, the checkout could also be streamlined. Currently they wait for you to approach the counter and ask if you want to buy anything. Ideally, they would greet you, ask how everything went, then offer to schedule your next appointment. A simple suggestion box or customer feedback card next to the desk would offer the opportunity for customers to discretely provide input on their experience that day or technician without resorting to public forums like Yelp.\n\nAll in all, I come here because it's affordable with the monthly membership and the wax service is quick. With that said, I may consider their other services if they made some improvements."", ""I think I've entered a new realm of Yelping with this one folks: Shauna gets her first Brazilian wax. \nLet's start by saying that things in the body hair department for me were a hot mess (or maybe just a mess) before Friday evening (what a wild Friday, right?). Being an incredibly anxious person, I researched the hell out of waxing before selecting The Naked Peach for my wax. If you've ever googled 'Brazilian wax' you already know you will be greeted with a montage of stories which make this sound like it's next on the pain scale to being hit by a truck and bleeding out slowly. I read about tons of people who did some combination of the following: puked, fainted, screamed, cried, left mid wax, were left without flesh, etc. Not exactly reassuring. \nI walked in The Peach after scheduling via Yelp earlier in the week (very timely with responding). I purchased a Groupon for a discount for new clients (only good for 1st time visitors). I checked in at the front desk and was offered drinks/snacks. My tech, Kay, was running approx 15 minutes late (wasn't a big deal to me) so I sat in the waiting area for a bit. I observed a few other folks checking in and the process is very streamline. This location is very busy and they set appointments every 15 minutes so they only have a 5 minute grace period for late arrivals. I love this, because I despise late folks (sorry). The shop itself is cute and clean.\nWhen my tech greeted me, she introduced herself and I informed her my anxiety. She made me feel comfortable and explained how the wax would go. I will spare you the details but I was very surprised at how not awful the whole thing was. I kept expecting it to get more painful and then, just like that we were done. Kay was very kind and chatted casually with me throughout the whole thing. \nAfterwards, I was given aftercare instructions and some samples of products offered. I booked a follow up appointment and was given information about Peach Club a monthly program were $35 is removed from an account of your choice and credited to your waxing account (Regular Brazilian would be $55 without club pricing).

Everyone is masked but most importantly my buns are soft and silky!!!\nI have been getting Brazilians for years and sometimes they can leave me feeling ewww.

If cost is not a factor for you, easily a 5-star review. I had placed this bakery in my ""Must Try"" Collection months ago due to its excellent reviews & my love for anything sweet. Today I was in the area on business & decided to stop in. I\'m happy I did. \n\nThis sweet shoppe is open Tues thru Friday 9 AM to 5 PM, & Saturdays from 10 AM to 6 PM. Owner & award-winning pastry Chef Brenda is professionally trained in French pastries, which is apparent w/ each bite of her beautiful creations. She is a two-time Food Network Challenge Winner. She is also a graduate of the esteemed Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. Due to her desire for others to ""indulge in the true meaning of the art of pastries,"" she masters in ""modern, minimalist & flavorful"" decedent creations. \n\nThe menu includes 8 pastries & 3 cake slices. The $10 Chocolate Praline was WONDERFUL w/ its salted caramel; chocolate; creme brulee; & hazelnut. (It didn\'t make it all the way home:). The Devils Blackberry Cake slice @ $12 w/ its blackberry marmalade mousse & fresh blackberries was just as DELICIOUS. It was so RICH that I stopped after two bites. The menu includes 11 baked goods. The $8.50 Triple Chocolate Bread Pudding was VERY GOOD. (A sweet sauce on top would have made it even better.) After reading other reviews, I obviously need to return to try the Kouign-Amann @ $5, which is a Breton Cake. It\'s often described as ""the fattiest cake in all of Europe."" (It\'s essentially a sweet & salty buttery cake w/ a caramelized crust.)\n\nThere are 4 ""Savory"" menu items, which include a quiche, souffle, & two croissant sandwiches, , there are Macaroons & Canele de Borxeaux-- a rum & vanilla pastry w/ a custard center & caramelized crust. \n\nIf it\'s a beverage you seek, there are three Teas (w/ add ons that include Sugar Free); Cold Drinks (juice, soda, & waters); & Coffees & Specialty Drinks such as Lattees; Cappachino; Cortado (Expresso w/ warm milk); & Mocha.\n\nThe eatery appeared very clean. There are a handful of inside tables as well as outside tables near the entrance. \n\n24 hours advanced notice is required on PRE ORDERS, 48 hours for cakes, & 2 weeks for custom cakes. Check out the website to see all the choices patrons have regarding custom orders-- six different cakes w/ ten available fillings! (Currently, Chef Brenda is fully booked w/ custom cake orders thru October 2021.)\n\n$25 Gift Cards are available for purchase. \n\nDefinitely a worthy bakery & coffee shoppe, especially if the higher prices are within your budget. I will definitely return the next time I\'m in the area-- such a quality (& tasty) establishment!', 'All the 5 star reviews are totally on point. I\'ve never actually said this before, but I would give Sucre Table more stars if I could. I never say that about any bakery. I am kicking myself for not visiting sooner. I\'ve honestly had this place bookmarked for a while, and I\'m so glad I finally got to try it.\n\nSo, it\'s in that old strip mall where the Little Donut Shop used to be on Kennedy Blvd. It\'s in the same plaza as Chicken Salad Chick, Poke Burri, and Revolution Ice Cream. It\'s also across the street from La Segunda Bakery. If you haven\'t been to Sucre Table yet then you\'re in for a big treat. Seriously, these are high end, quality pastries with a beautiful presentation. The kind of pastries you can give as gifts because they are so beautifully decorated, and that\'s only if you think they will make it to their destination. I\'m not gifting any of it. It would all be for me.\n\nLet me first start with the kouign-amann (KA) pastry. WOW!! I loved it so much that I bought another to take with me. I did not share it with anyone. I had it for breakfast this morning after heating it up in the oven and it was just as good as the day before. I\'ve heard about this pastry before but never actually had one until this visit. All I know is that it originally comes from Brittany which is a part of France that I haven\'t visited yet. I\'m putting it on my bucket list because now I\'m obsessed with learning more about pastries from that region. I think I may even watch episode 7 of collection 1 of the Netflix series ""The Great British Baking Show"" to see how the KA pastry is made. Anyway, this buttery and sugary layered pastry is a denser version of the Dominique Ansel cronut. My description doesn\'t even give it justice. Just read about it. Chef Brenda is extremely talented and has worked in the best NYC bakeries. What can I say? \n\nI also had to try the sour sop passion fruit tart. Another WOW!! The natural flavor of the tart passion fruit along with the sweet cream layer of guanabana made this the perfect ending for me. I enjoyed savoring every last crumb off that plate. A perfect 10.\n\nThe ube spiced latte was also a winner. It was made with coconut milk which really brought out the flavors. It\'s limited and it\'s not even on the menu at the moment, but they were able to make it for me. I appreciated that because it was one of the chai drinks that I wanted to try. Oh, and everyone was so helpful and friendly from the counter associate, to the barista, and to the owner/chef who was also there tending to her business. The tables are spaced apart and they even had a few tables outside. The décor and ambiance makes it a very relaxing and classy place to have a pastry with your coffee or tea preparation. They also have savory croissants, quiche, and soufflé. There\'s an online preorder menu and they take custom cake orders with some really unique cake fillings. \n\nI can\'t wait to go back to try a slice of cake and many other treats that I saw in the case. I don\'t have a single negative thing to say. It\'s worth a million more visits.', ""One of the best bakeries in Tampa Bay.\n\nI sent my sister to pick us up some baked goods, so I can't speak to the actual physical location, but I can comment on the food. Unfortunately, they didn't have kouign-amann when she went, which just means I'll have to go back.\n\nCroissant - Best croissant I've had in Tampa Bay and definitely one of the top ones I've had in my life. It's flaky and buttery, exactly how I like my carbs. I'm not a huge carb eater because it's usually not worth the calories for me, but this one absolutely is. \n\nEgg Croissant sandwich - Usually this comes with bacon, but since I don't eat pork I took it off. It was very good, but I rather savor the croissant instead of add to it, so I think I'll stick to just a croissant next time. \n\nPistachio Tiramisu - My absolute favorite. It's almost like a mousse on the inside and the dome of chocolate gives it a great (and I'm throwing up in my mouth a little for using this term, but I don't know how else to put it) mouth feel. I kept trying to send my sister back to get this again, but unfortunately they were closed on Sunday when she was free. \n\nGoat Cheese Carrot Cake - I really like the use of goat cheese in this pastry. It has a LOT of icing, so you need to be an icing person to like this. That being said, I LOVE icing. The goat cheese made it not too sweet and the actual cake was very moist. I love the uniqueness of this cake and would recommend it to anyone looking for something a little different. \n\nI will be going back soon. I just wish it was closer.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,

In the past, movers have scratched my furniture, broken my favorite lamp, sexted with my sister, written lewd messages in BLACK MARKER all over my comic book collection and even put my stuffed animals into sexual positions - not funny.\n\nI could tell right away that Tom would provide me a good experience. I had heard from Craig\'s List about the ""works"" package, so I asked Tom about it. He wouldn\'t discuss it on the phone, but in person we negotiated and let me just say this - he delivered! Both me and my girlfriend at the time were FULLY satisfied (she\'s hard to please). Tom and one of the other guys (I forget his name) even hung around for a while afterwards and had a couple drinks after the move and our ""business"" was completed. I left a $100 tip, which I thought was standard considering what they did for us.\n\nI\'d recommend the Sultans of Schlep to anyone. Here\'s a tip - order ""the works,"" and make sure you set aside about 30 minutes of private time during the move (wear loose clothes).

Part of that was made possible by the Sultans of Schlep. This was my first time hiring proper movers and I don't think I'll ever go back(1). Tom was easy to work with on the phone (and a very frequent leaver of voicemails while I was busy) and the flat fee rate he set plus the hourly rate was more than fair. \n\nThe guys picked up all my stuff from a storage unit in Philly (plus the extra furniture my Dad drove up from VA to PA) then drove it up to NYC on the Sunday of Labor Day weekend. They unloaded my entire life and even set up my bedframe (no easy feat).  In return, I gave them a nice tip and some real New York bagels. Then I unpacked all the boxes of wine and properly started my new life.\n\nThey even invoiced me via PayPal which was better than any cash-only deal I would have been stuck with otherwise.\n\nFootnote 1: Schuyler L helped me actually get all my stuff into the storage unit in the first place.

Well,  if you are only looking for great service during a stressful move then you might want to consider the Sultans as well. \n\n[transition with a riff from Dire Straits here ...]\n\nGreat service begins at the very beginning when you talk to Tom to schedule your move. Super helpful and friendly. He was very clear about pricing and our options (I was really impressed how they only charge to the quarter hour when you settle up at the end of the day). Tom sent me email and text confirmations right before the move. He also was really cool about shifting dates at the last minute and scheduling a second move (reasons listed below) quickly.\n\nOur move was quite possibly the suckiest move in the annals of moves. We bought a house with no plans to do so and had to get our old house on the market immediately. As a result, we had to throw a lot of stuff into 2 gigantic storage units really quickly. Sure, you are saying, like everybody else. Does your husband have a wood shop full of tools and slabs of trees? Trees, I say! Does your husband have the largest antique tool collection in the contiguous USA? Anvils, people; these guys had to move anvils. And post vices. And boxes of axes. Did I mention the blacksmithing forge? Anyway, everything we own is heavy. Not just ""heavy"" but ""Holy s***, what the f***?"" heavy. And quantity. If my husband didn\'t actually use most of this crap he could probably be on a new series called Hoarders in Training. \n\nWhile this situation may have caused a few looks of confusion and shock  (or did they get a ""shiver in the dark""? -- sorry, last Dire Straits reference, I promise) when we opened up the storage area, the guys were otherwise not perturbed in the slightest, or at least were really good actors. On two separate weekends, they carried all of this stuff out of storage, into truck, and then into our barn, workshop, basement. And it was HOT! They didn\'t complain and were in a good mood or joking the whole time. Granted, this may have been exhaustion-induced delirium, but I think they are just really laid-back guys.\n\nAnd no one was scary. Trust me, we had another company move us into our house and movers can be scary people. Both crews were made up of super nice guys, who took time to answer my 2-year-olds questions each time they passed by, stepped over my nosy dog, and didn\'t bludgeon my husband with one of his many, many, MANY tools. That  may have been warranted in this situation.\n\nLong story short, I would hire them again in a second, but really hope we don\'t have to ever again.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,

It is very much at the middle of two open air structures. \n\nThey occupied three vender stands and a front open air stand. You will not miss it. The front vender stand offers the roast cone and broil peanut. They roasted their corn in the enclose smoker. Once they receive the order, they will peel off the skin and show the ear. Then they will dip the corn to the hot butter, and season with salt, parmesan cheese (yum), Cajun spice (wow). My wife loves this corn. The inner vender stand serves the deep fried corn, crab cake, gator bites, and frog leg. They also serve different type of fruit drink and icy. We were curious the deep fry corn did not turn to pop corn. The vender owner assures us it will not happen. Evidently, it does not and coated with thin cajun coating. I have concluded the deep fried corn is a boy food and the roast corn is girl food base on the preference.\n\nWe also order the home made crab cake. The surprise is not the crab cake; it is the side dish that comes with it. The deep fried kale. I have the deep fried kale at the Cool Bean restaurant in Tallahasse FL.

Last month, I visited for a little R & R before a special occasion and was treated like absolute royalty. The spa was immaculate, spacious, aromatic and just what I needed. \n\nMy massage therapist and pedicurist were both sweethearts. At the start of my pedi, I was offered a mimosa which I happily accepted.', 'I\'ve been to the Ritz NOLA Spa 3 times now. Twice for balls to the wall, full couple\'s days & once for a spur of the moment couple\'s massage. So, obviously I like it & it\'s the best spa I\'ve seen in NOLA (Gotta have a steam room). But it\'s not perfect, hence the 2 star deduction.\n\nFacilities: Unfortunately, each lounge is gender segregated. Given my boobs & vagina, I\'m relegated to the loquacious hell that is the Women\'s Lounge:  \n\nRelaxation Area: This area is beautifully appointed & would be a nice place to chill or nap between services, only it\'s not. Why? Because women won\'t shut the hell up! While there is a sign indicating the prohibition of cell use in this area, there is apparently no policy to curtail other noise. How cell phone chatting is different from racket in person is a mystery apparently known only to the Ritz Carlton.\n\nThe 1st time I was here there was an excruciatingly loud bachelorette party that made any attempts to relax completely futile. And when I was there recently, 2 hens squawked for over 2 hours. No one is that interesting. Each time I spoke to staff about the racket. The responses, ""It gets busy on the weekends."" Apparently I have to take a day off during the week if I actually want to relax in the Ritz\'s ""relaxation"" lounge.\n\nVanity Area: Vanities, toilets, showers, sauna & steam room. I\'m not a fan of dry saunas, so I can\'t speak intelligently on the Ritz\'s. However, their steam room, replete with icy, cucumber washrags, is sublime. The temperature is always just hot enough, but not suffocating.  \n\nIt\'s also worth noting that there is something of a ""secret"" shower, between the sauna and the steam room. While there is a line of perfectly great regular showers, this separate shower has all the multi-jet bells and whistles.\n\nThere\'s also an extensive selection of products and beauty tools, such as shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, deodorant, shaving cream, hair gel, moisturizer, hair dryers, curling irons, flat irons, combs, brushes & even sugar to give yourself a good scrub. Note however that for those of you with curly hair, they do not have volumizing diffusers, so bring your own. Don\'t be like the woman who asked to borrow mine because the answer is no. I\'d rather chew broken glass than let a stranger mash my diffuser into her hair.\n\nLocker room: Pretty standard with lockers and benches. Plenty of room & a changing room with a door for the self conscious.\n\nThe Men\'s Lounge: Sadly, I\'ve never been in the men\'s lounge. But my man tells me it\'s a magical place where no one talks. They also have a TV. So unfair.\n\nHot Tub/Pool: This indoor area is accessible through the fitness room. It\'s coed, so you need a swimsuit if you want to go into the water.  But my man and I did just fine dipping our legs into the pool in our robes and it was a nice respite from the women\'s ""relaxation"" area.\n\nStaff: Aside from either an unwillingness or an inability to do anything about the noise, the staff is efficient, friendly, attentive and skilled. You\'ll never go very long before you see someone in the Women\'s Lounge if you need anything.\n\nServices:\n\nApothecary Scrub Bar: You pick out a scrub, oil, & an herb. Then you lie down on a table where you\'re either being cascaded with water from a multi-nozzle shower arm overhead or scrubbed thoroughly, all before an application of moisturizer. This is my favorite service & Beth was awesome.  She also recommended the cafe au lait body polish ($10 cheaper than the Apothecary) in the future & even gave me a sample of the cafe au lait scrub.\n\n80 Min. Couple\'s Massage: Just what it sounds like. We get Swedish, and the pressure is always just right. My only complaint here is that the massage room is apparently right under a guest room & the sound of high heels clicking & clacking back and forth from above during my recent visit was more than a little annoying.\n\nSignature Facial: My face felt wonderful after & again, Beth was the bomb!  Includes an extraction & a hand, arm & scalp massage.\n\nCouple\'s Bath: A private bath in a nice, lighted hot tub with candles, roses & champagne. Nice, but overpriced at only 20 mins. Skip it unless you have a crummy little bathroom like mine.\n\nDeluxe Mani/Pedi: The included massage & paraffin felt great & the couple\'s, side by side pedi is fun. But if you\'re more interested in the results, spend less money elsewhere.  I\'ve seen better polish application & their nail technicians just don\'t understand that ""rounded"" means NO square edges, not even where the nail meets the digit.  Also, their pedi chair felt more like being beaten with a sack of potatoes than a massage.  I couldn\'t adjust my chair, so perhaps this potato beat down was just because the chair was broken & stalled at the strongest setting.', 'I\'m baaaaaaack!!!!!\n\nNot my 1st time at this rodeo. Won\'t say I\'m a frequent flyer, buuuuut I\'ve been here a couple times before. And I\'m sorry to say, this experience was no better... Lol.

And honestly, deeeeeeeep really deep down inside, I think that maybe, just maybe, it\'ll get better  but yeah; that\'s my thought, soooo until then, I\'ll finish my review. \n\nSooooooo yeah where was I???? Oh yeah, so my masseuse, Gabby, was sub par. At the culmination of my services, I asked the folks at the front desk how long has she been here... 5 years they said... Ummmmm I was like ""wait, what""?  My companion\'s masseuse was Mary, whom I hear was excellent. So I guess it\'s hit or miss. \n\nThere was lots of noise made (inclusive of her stomach growling) during my session & as a result, I could NOT relax. And after she left the room, I had to wipe my own hands, as she left the oil on my hands. Ummmmmmm this was a no-no. How am I to redress with oil on my hands?????

Their menu included beignets, coffee and a variety of other drinks.

Serving Vietnamese and or regular sandwiches all made on just right texture for banh mi baquette (made daily for them by Orient Market in Boise), pho, bun (one of our favorite SE Asian noodle dishes) and fresh (spring) rolls at bargain prices.\n\nTHE DRILL\nBig menu boards are posted over the counter.  Order there, they'll give you a number and then call it when your order is ready to pick up.  Which is in short order.\n\nTHE VIBE\nThen you can carry it back to your seat at maybe eight or so lino topped tables (seating for 18ish people), if you're lucky enough to get a seat at all, to polish off your meal in equally short order.  This is not a place you'll choose to dine and linger, but eat and go.  Or take out.  Seating being as limited as it is in the tight space.   \n\nTHE FOOD\nIn addition to 10 or 12 different Vietnamese style sandwiches there are an equal number of standard sandwiches, pho (beef) and bun (four kinds).  Since the latter is a favorite dish for us, we might have ordered it except we didn't see it on the menu board and only learned they had it as we read a paper menu at the table as we inhaled, ummm...ate...the banh mi.  Which will lead to a comment about service...to follow.\n\nThey also make 4 kinds of fresh (spring) rolls daily and have them shrink wrapped in packages of 3 (only $4) at the counter to pick up and take with you.  We had barely made a dent in our shrimp fresh rolls with peanut sauce when they called our number for the bbq (in the SE Asian style not American style) pork bahn mi.\n\nThe bahn mi we wisely decided to share because it is plenty big enough even though it carries a modest price tag of just under $5.  The baguette was perfect pillowy-meets-chewy essential for this kind of sandwich and the flavorful grilled meat filling was ample.  But for us it wasn't quite the 'all that' we expected based on some reviews.\n\nThat is because for us the point of banh mi is the abundance of pickled fresh vegetables, SE Asian herbs and hot fresh peppers.  While there were fresh vegetables they were not abundant and the pickling was barely there.  The fresh cilantro was good but the jalapeno,sliced lengthwise, was quite thick.  YOWZA!  I like heat but if you're more faint of heart for that bite, you might search and remove beforehand.\n\nThey also have bahn mi made with the pate style pork roll that is likely the most traditional filling of all and it appeared in a couple of their sandwiches.  Vegetarian options also available.\n\nTHE SERVICE\nThe lady at the counter was all business as she took our order.  This is not the place to ask to have described what this item or that one is.  We felt a little like being in a Senifeld episode (you know that Soup Nazi skit) when we asked what was the difference between a 'sandwich only' and 'combo order'.  (Answer, fyi, is chips and soda with the latter...nope...not our thing.)  So the point is, if you don't know something about SE Asian sandwiches and food, it is best to learn that before you go in.  We were glad we didn't need the person behind the counter to walk us through.  Nice lady.  But the routine is specific.\n\nALL IN ALL...\n...good enough that we'd go back if in the area at the right time of day when for a quick lunch.  In particular since we didn't notice the bun options until too late to order one of them.   But this wouldn't be a destination for us.\n\nTHIS N THAT:\n\n1) PARKING:  Ample amount in the big Fred Meyer's lot but somehow it always seems as this lot if full no matter how big it is.\n\n2) ACCESSIBILITY:  Level in and throughout the small space.  Tables are standard height and a few have ample floor space for wheelchair users.  But likely best to plan to leave strollers outside here.  The parking lot is woefully out of compliance with Federal Law and State Structural Code for accurate number and placement of accessible parking spots."", ""Baguette Deli is located in the same plaza as Fred Meyer, specifically next door to Great Clips, with plenty of parking.\n\nMy husband found this place on Yelp and so we came here on a Sunday around 6:30 pm. After looking over the menu board, we ended up getting:\n\nVermicelli, $7.95 prior to tax- This noodle entrée is good for two and was tasty. The meat was also good and tender.\n\n#1 House Special, $4.95 prior to tax- My husband opted for this sandwich. The lunch meat is good but on the skimpy side. The baguette bread used was good and had a nice chew.\n-----------------\n(Total= $13.14 after tax)\n\nWhen we came in, I wanted to order spring rolls but they were already sold out. Same with a milk tea that I had asked to purchase. I was surprised that a handful of items I had asked for were already sold out ~ 90 minutes before closing time. But I guess at least they still had the ingredients to make banh mi sandwiches.\n\nWell I've had better, but maybe that's because I'm from Los Angeles where there are a lot of places that make really good Vietnamese food. Overall, this place is okay, thus my 3 star rating."", ""Went here after a receiving recommendation for their sandwiches and pho.

Secondly, I met my barber(can\'t remember his name) and he was very cold and didn\'t say much.  Third, I asked for the most basic, simple haircut. I just wanted in shortened a little bit.  Simple, right? Guess not. Fourth, he goes about cutting my hair with the seat positioned so I can\'t see what\'s going on. This position is such that I can\'t see myself in the mirror and have no idea what he\'s doing to my hair!  About 10 minutes in, I notice that he starts cutting the front of my scalp a lot. I, like a moron, figure there is no need to worry since this place got such rave reviews! When he\'s done, he hands me a mirror and I take a quick glance at the cut and I didn\'t realize how bad it was till later. I don\'t like to complain and just said ""looks good, thanks"".

I can barely tell my left from right (""Your other left is a phrase that is often repeated to me), I honestly have no idea what people talking about when they say NE, NW, SW, SE, and the compass app on my phone is completely useless. Basically I\'m telling you, I could not walk my way out of a paper bag.\n\nSo when the boy surprised me with an impromptu trip to New Orleans for my birthday we spent our first day wandering the streets with no real places to go. Sure it\'s a wonderful city but we had a limited amount of time, places to go, and most importantly things to eat. It was time to call in the professionals. I emailed Le Monde Creole at 2 am in the morning to book a two and half hour tour of the city.\n\nYeah it\'s touristy, but I highly suggest taking a walking tour. This trip helped us take in the culture better and also plan the rest of our trip there!\n\nI could not be happier with our host Bill, a local with a knack for storytelling. His musical, lilting voice took us into the story of the a Creole French family in the 19th century. Let me tell you, this is no American Girl story. The Lacoul Family had everything you could ever want: sex, intrigue, violence and scandal! I held on to every single word. For a girl who was diagnosed with ADD by a psychic at her high school graduation (another story, another day) this is quite the feat.\n\nI highly, highly recommend this tour. Besides the story you will also get to check out some private New Orleans courtyards (including one where an American Horror Story scene was filmed!), cemeteries (and see the NIcholas Cage future burial place), pharmacies, houses, etc!', 'I was very frustrated and upset by this tour. \n\nThe quick and dirty:\n\n* The tour ran almost TWICE as long as advertised. \n* There were only four courtyards visited, and they were all, as far as I could tell, publicly accessible. Not one was, as the website claims, private. \n* We spent more time locked in confined spaces listening to lectures than we spent looking at beautiful architecture or museums.\n* For running two hours late (almost four hours total!), no time was provided to look around or take photos and we were rushed through everything interesting. \n\nThe long version:\n\nThe website said the tour would take ""about"" two hours.Since the tour starts around 10:30, that would mean we ended around lunch, which is what I planned for. We actually ended well after 2 PM. The tour took almost twice as long as anticipated. Not only that, but it ended well after lunch. As I\'m a person who needs to eat on time, I was miserable and exhausted by the time the tour wound up. Furthermore, I only had one day in New Orleans and had planned my schedule carefully. An almost two (?!) hour delay meant I had to cancel other items on my to-do list and miss out on a lot of fun, like visiting the cemetery in the Garden District (which was closed by the time I got there).\n\nI would probably have forgiven this IF it meant we had taken more time in special spots, or saw a lot of neat, fun, interesting architecture that I could not have seen otherwise.  However, that was not the case.\n\nFirst stop: A courtyard behind an ice cream shop (publicly accessible). It was here we spent the most time, sitting for what felt like more than an hour  hearing a very meandering explanation of New Orleans history that basically felt like a Wikipedia article read aloud. This was all information that could have easily been conveyed en route between destinations, and, since I was already familiar with this history of the region, it was torturous to be forced sit and feel the minutes drag by while our tour guide drank her coffee. We weren\'t even allowed to get up and look around the courtyard.  \n\nSecond stop: A courtyard in a local history museum (which was free, btw, and publicly accessible). After being rushed through the museum and told that we should consider ""coming back later to really look around"" we were led out to the courtyard and given an interesting talk on Creole courtyards, which I did enjoy. I did not enjoy that the second the talk was over, we were rushed out of the space without being given time to look around or take photos. We were there less than ten minutes, fifteen tops if you include time spent walking through the museum.\n\nThird stop: Pharmacy museum and courtyard. A lovely courtyard, also publicly accessible. A shame we were only there less than five minutes. We were then rushed up through an interesting stairwell into the pharmacy museum where, instead of being allowed to look around, we got a brief but salacious recounting of Laura Locoul with lots of obvious questions and Innuendo. I think the pharmacy museum would be a great place to visit, but I wouldn\'t know because I didn\'t really get to visit it.\n\nNext was the cemetery, where we did get about two minutes of  interesting history, and over five minutes on why we should not desecrate tombs before being rushed out without time for photos or to look around. \n\nFinally we reached our last destination--Laura Lecoul\'s town house. Oh, lovely, her actual home! This is the only (apparently, not 100% sure) non-freely accessible location, since you\'d normally have to pay for a tour of the home from what I gathered as we rushed past the reception desk. We didn\'t pay, but we didn\'t get a tour of the home, either. We were whisked through the courtyard (less than one minute this time, in and out and through as quickly as the tour guide could manage), past a tantalizing staircase that promised a lovely home that we would never see as we were herded  into a dark, windowless living room where the tour guide SHUT THE DOORS to give us another painfully long family story that seemed barely relevant. Meanwhile, we are sitting in a dark, tiny room of a gorgeous New Orleans town house with a gorgeous New Orleans courtyard, looking at antique reproduction furniture and an anachronistic mirrored fireplace and thinking of all the amazing house we are not seeing that we could be seeing at that exact moment. \n\nTo someone who loves architecture and homes it was like that science experiment where they tell the children that they have to wait for the marshmallow and if they wait, they will get two marshmallows. But then imagine at the end of a three and a half hour exercise in frustration and boredom, the child is told to please buy the tour guide\'s eBook and get the hell out and don\'t you dare try to linger or look around because the TOUR IS OVER.', ""We found Le Monde Creole via Yelp and it didn't disappoint.  What I really liked was that much of the tour took place in quiet, out of the way spots.  Our tour organizer did an excellent job presenting an overview of New Orleans, cultural fun facts and the story about the Creole family.  It was fun ducking into beautiful courtyards and hearing stories that took me back to another time.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,

Most of the food items on offer for their happy hour menu are pathetically small and a waste of time and money to even order while the main decent special they offer would be the 50 cent raw oysters.  The service is really slow and mediocre at best.  The drinks are ok but their happy hour prices are not all that happy and still seem overpriced.  The crowd usually seems that it isn't a very friendly or happy gathering type so this place just lacks the usual happy friendly vibe most NOLA establishments generally offer.  The bar itself has a nice ambiance and very comfortable seating which is unchanged since before Katrina and still works quite well.  Overall without the 50 cent oysters there would really be no need to even visit here and even with the oyster special Superior Seafood offers a more enjoyable friendly crowd along with their 50 cent oyster special which also offers much better drink specials.""]",0.5,0.0,0.25,0.25,0.0,1.0,30.0

I don\'t understand why they haven\'t made some effort to replace them.

It was a spinach omelette with Swiss cheese, topped with another tomato, bacon, more cheese, and avocado. The omelette on the bottom actually stayed hot longer that way, with the cooler items on top instead of being stuffed inside.\n\nMy husband ordered The Brunchery Benedict, which was poached eggs, ham, mushrooms & Swiss. I had a bite and it was delicious. The hollandaise sauce was perfect. He had the seasoned potatoes with his. I tasted those as well, delicious and he agreed, but there was a lot of them (and that Benedict was very large) and he said he wished he had substituted tomatoes for his as well. \n\nThe prices were great for the amount of food we received.

Highly recommend these guys and wouldn't hesitate to bring my car there again."", 'I want to preface this by saying that they have a lot of great reviews, so my experience may be atypical. I trusted them largely based on these reviews, however, so I feel that I should share my experience.\n\nFirst off, they do beautiful body work, which is the reason they got two stars at all. Even the dealership has trouble matching my paint color, but Philadelphia Auto Body had no trouble making my car look like new. They also did a great job detailing the interior - it looked and smelled great when I got it back a month later.\n\nWhen I came to pick up the car, the back hubcap was still damaged from where it bounced off the curb. They claimed the insurance company didn\'t believe it was related to the accident and wouldn\'t pay for it. I was mad, but it was cosmetic and I\'d been without my car for a month, so I just accepted it.\n\nI left and picked up my friend, and she immediately commented that the car was pulling to the left. I blamed the road, because I figured they JUST fixed it, that couldn\'t be possible. I noticed it too, but I thought I was crazy. My mom told me to try driving it on different roads, different conditions, etc. Then my mom and cousin drove it, and both noticed it pulling. I called P.A.B. to let them know, and they tried to tell me that the damage was to the back end and that would have no effect on the front end, so it must have been pulling before. That is possibly the dumbest statement I\'ve ever heard from someone who supposedly works on cars, because even I know that the back and front end are connected, and the car was definitely NOT pulling before the accident. Then he tried to tell me I must have hit a pothole and screwed up the alignment. I informed him I did not hit a pothole. Essentially, he didn\'t believe me, and kept trying to convince me that I should have come back sooner, even though I explained that the reason I didn\'t return sooner was because I TRUSTED THEIR WORK, and thought I was the crazy one. \n\nI told my mom, and she called the insurance company, and they agreed it could go back to the shop. She also mentioned the hubcap. The insurance company said that they had in fact paid for that to be repaired. P.A.B.\'s excuse? ""They must have gotten confused about which vehicle it was for."" Ok, fine, we\'re all human and mistakes happen. My friend took the car in for me at 8am on her day off. They said it would be ready by 4, so she could pick me up from work. I called at 3, and they adjusted that to 4:30. It wasn\'t done until around 6pm, and the issue was that the first time around they had ""forgotten"" a plastic part that the wheel needed. They also scratched up the back bumper while it was there, but I\'d rather live with the damage than leave my car with them for another minute. \n\nLong story short: if all you need is body work, they will do a beautiful job on your car and you\'ll be very pleased with the results. If you need anything mechanical done, go elsewhere, because in my personal experience they were disorganized and careless with that part of the repairs.', 'I had Philadelphia Auto Body detail my car, which was already in very good shape, with high expectations.  The reviews on Yelp are very good, and in speaking with Dave, the manager (I believe) it was nothing but positive.  I had the work done about six weeks, or so, ago.  They pickup and drop off the car, which is a great service.  \n\nThe work they did was very inconsistent.  The exterior detail was done well, and they were able to recondition the headlight lenses to look nearly new.  The wax and claybar work looked good.  There did not appear to be any plastic or rubber treatment on any surfaces, however, which was a big gap.  The tires did look as if they may had been treated, though it was a little hard to tell.  \n\nThe interior of my car was very clean to begin with; my primary reason for taking the car in was to have the outside done before the weather hit.  It appeared that not very much was done on the inside, and again, no plastic or rubber treatments on any of the surfaces that I could see.  Even if they were using a low-sheen product, it\'s still evident that surfaces would have been treated.  The carpet cleaning was just OK, but it wasn\'t clear if they had cleaned the mats and carpets, or just the carpets.  There were still some dirt/grime marks on the headliner, as well.  The biggest issue I had was that the leather did not appear to have been touched at all.  It still had some minor dirt and grime on the seats, though again, the car was pretty clean to begin with.  I ended up having to clean and condition the leather myself.  \n\nI left two messages for Dave over the next two weeks, and also used the shop\'s online form to submit a request that someone contact me.  I have never heard back from anyone at the shop to discuss my concerns.  \n\nThe big rub here is that I have a 2008 Smart Car...just about the smallest car you can imagine.  Despite this, I still paid $250+tax for the ""detail"" job, which included the claybar treatment.  The work was not ""detailed"" at all, and in fact I significantly overpaid for the services they provided, based on the fact that the interior was not fully detailed, no plastic/rubber treatment was used on most of the car, and the leather hadn\'t been cleaned and conditioned.  \n\nThis was a very disappointing experience, since the reviews are very good, and when I spoke with Dave pre-sale, he was very accommodating.  I\'m very surprised to have to write such a negative review, but I simply haven\'t been able to get hold of anyone at the shop to discuss this, and I just don\'t have time to go there in person.  They really need to keep a closer eye on their work...and understand that a ""detail"" is just that.  \n\n-Jason']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,

Coming from a big city, I was skeptical of the Chinese food in the area so asked one of my local friends who had also spent some time in China, and he recommended Kung Fu Noodle. ""Silly name, great food"", he said. Since my dad was in town, I took him here.\n\nKung Fu Noodle offers ~10 dishes on a hand-written menu all price around $8, and I imagine they do them all really well. They offer noodle soups, dry noodles, and an assortment of dumplings and bao (Chinese buns often filled with stuff). I shared the chef\'s special sauce noodles and bao with my dad. The noodles were in a brown sauce, tossed with ground meat, scallions, and chili sauce. They were perfectly cooked and had that unique flavor of home-made noodles. The bao were crispy on the outside and had juicy pork on the inside. Plus, one order came with 6 huge bao for only $8. These dishes really transported me back to the time I was in Beijing. My dad, who grew up in China, was equally impressed.\n\nThe table next to us got soup noodles and the servings were HUGE. I will definitely come back in winter time when I need something hot.\n\nService was great. We waited a bit for the bao since they make them in-house and ready to order, but the waitress kept coming to update us and ask if we needed anything. Place was very clean and nicely decorated.\n\nThis will definitely become one of my regular spots. And if any of my relatives or Chinese food-loving friends come to visit me in Tucson, I will definitely take them here.', 'This is the kind of place you go for certain dishes, and if you get the wrong dish, you might be disappointed.\n\nSo what to get at a place called Kung Fu Noodle? Well, being a Taiwanese style noodle restaurant, you can\'t go wrong with the beef noodle soup. Flavor wise, it\'s as good as beef noodle soup I\'ve had in Los Angeles, although I will say that I wish they had more beef. Noodles are nicely done, and the broth is just wonderfully spicy with just a little hint of sweetness from the star anise/cinnamon and whatever other spices they put in there. It\'s awesome.\n\nIn addition, it\'s the only place in Tucson where you can get Taiwanese street food, like the ""Chinese burrito"" and various buns. I wasn\'t a huge fan of their ""hamburger"", but the Chinese burrito and the green onion pancake are awesome. Probably the only complaint is that they\'re pretty expensive, especially compared to other cities, but I guess when you\'re the only show in town you can charge what you like. Not a huge complaint; after all, I\'m happy this place exists in Tucson.\n\nService is actually not bad considering it\'s a pretty authentic Chinese place (back in LA, if you go to a Chinese restaurant with good service, you can pretty much guarantee that it\'s either overpriced or caters to Americanized tastes). \n\nSo overall, go and get the beef noodle soup, the green onion pancake, and the Chinese burrito and you most likely won\'t be disappointed!', ""If you want to know how it feels like HOME from this cultural setting, this is the place to go! \n\nWe were greeted by friendly and very sweet aunties, and introduced themselves as we were seated at our table. Walking in, the restaurant was clean, kept neat. The warm, yet not too bright ambience created a comfortable space for me and my companion. Decorations in there are beautiful, not overwhelming and pleasant to the eyes. \n\n When we asked questions about the menu, they were patient when giving us more detail about their favorite items on the menu. The wait wasn't long for the food, though are a bit pricey than other Chinese/Taiwanese restaurants, the portions are generous which is fair. \n\nI've tried orange chicken, but never had a texture and taste quite like this one. Perfectly moist, CRUNCHY, then soft on the inside... and the first taste of tanginess and aftertaste of sweetness is really something! That especially was really good! \n\nIf you're in for a big appetite, order a bowl of beef noodles, they're large in portion, good for the price, savory and well balanced in flavor of the bok choy, beef cuts and thick noodles.\nThe dumplings were great as well, and I could've eaten a ton of them by themselves! \n\nService was good with the aunties, great food, and a satisfied belly with scrumptious food that feels so much like a hearty home-cooked meal.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

Los Comparres had disturbingly filthy chairs, tables, floors, a sad tent that doesn\'t even cover the whole outdoor area, takes too long to serve food, is in a bad part of town, and delivers nowhere near the type of atmosphere service or food as compared to many other South Tampa Spanish restaurants that hold a far superior $2 taco night with full service and comfortable clean sit-down accommodations. Los Comparres is located off Hillsborough and Armenia, in a dark dingy parking lot not very visible on the street. If you absolutely have to try this place, make sure you call ahead to place your order or get it delivered from grub hub as Los Comparres staff has been known to take their sweet time with 20-50 minute wait times depending on how busy it gets. I would also get your food to go as the dirty tent, dirty chairs, and dirty table is hardly accommodating for more than 4 people, let alone appetizing. Even with calling ahead, there was a 10 minute wait which was pretty painful as I couldn\'t sit anywhere and ended up getting a good look around at how truly dirty and dumpy the place was. Perhaps this food truck shouldn\'t have even bothered putting up any chairs or tables if they\'re not going to bother regularly cleaning them because the dirty as sin ones they have really detract from the experience of the place and aren\'t enough to accommodate all patrons. With the state of dirtiness of the chairs and tables, you really have to wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen and food here.  After waiting around for 10 minutes and finally receiving our food we called ahead for that should\'ve been ready upon arrival, we sped home and try to wipe the images of despair and dirtiness out of our minds and not associate it with our food. I got the $10 XL portion of Steak Quesadillas which consisted of 4 disturbingly large quesadilla pieces on top of each other. I was wondering if they gave me this much ""steak"" how are they making any money? The xl quesadilla is definitely enough to split between 2 people or make into 2 meals. I\'d recommend getting a $6 medium quesadilla and maybe a $2 taco if you\'re really hungry. My friend got 5 of the $2 Tacos including the Carne Asada (steak), Pastor (Marinated Pork), Camaron (shrimp), Barbacoa (bbq pork), and Lengua (tongue). The $2 Tacos only come with onions and cilantro while the $2.50 US Tacos come with onions, tomatoes, cilantro, lettuce, cheese, and sour cream. Los Comparres also serves burritos for $7, salad for $6, tostadas, ceviche, campechana, seafood cocktail, horchata, Jamaica  and Tamarindo. The food we ordered ended up being pretty good, maybe because we waited so long that we were starving. Their portion sizes were pretty large, and the signature green, red, and orange hot sauces to put on the Tacos were quite tasty. However, without the hot sauces these tacos would not score such high marks. There was not a lot of flavor to the Tacos. Los Comparres needs to marinate their meats better, routinely clean their tables, chairs, floors, kitchen, produce food in a more timely manner, and invest a little in decent chairs and tables that can accommodate more people to score more stars.', ""Why 4 stars? Because my steak quesadillas were good, but my shrimp taco was better.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nWhen I see a place with a 5-star average and north of 100 reviews, I know that I basically don't even have an option\xa0- I'm going there. The result? I loved my shrimp taco, but thought the steak quesadilla could use some improvement. \n\nFirst of all, on a hot day, brace yourself for some perspiration occurring. There's a small covered area with a couple of fans, but it's like sitting in a microwave on a warm day, because you're so close to the cooking area inside the truck and there's no breeze. I think the best option is to order, and wait in your car. If the weather is nice, I'm sure it's a much different story, though!\n\nI ordered a medium steak quesadilla, which was $6. Because I anticipated it to not be very large, I went ahead and ordered a shrimp taco as well. Once I had my food, I opened my small box with the shrimp taco instead, and it was phenomenal. I was ready to sing the praises of Los Comparres from the mountain tops!\n\nThen I opened my quesadilla box... wow. This was more food than two people would normally be able to eat during lunch. I was very pleasantly surprised that this was only $6! And it looked great! My issue, however, is that it seemed like the cut of steak was not ideal. Many of the bites were really chewy/fatty. It's possible that some lengua (tongue) meat was used, which is not what I would have preferred. \n\nProps to Las Comparres on the shrimp taco and the size of the quesadilla, but I'd avoid steak in the future. I do prefer Los Comparres to Loli's, and look forward to visiting again.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0

Madison made our tour one of the best ones I've ever had. He was diligent in texting me when he was coming to pick up my family and was on time! Madison also had extensive knowledge of the New Orleans area and was very funny and witty telling jokes and relating with the guests on our tour. Through our conversations, we found out that Madison is a very educated man holding a degree in Physics from Tulane! How about that!!! He was able to explain some physics to my children as well as tell us about the realities of the people we were seeing as we were driving towards the Plantation. He explained to us about the history of the people around the area and that many were actually descendants of the slaves that were working on the fields. He also explained the history of the Creole movement which I found truly fascinating! When we reached the plantations, Madison was quick to grab our tickets and we were swiftly off learning all the rich historical history of the Laura plantation and Oak Alley Plantation! Simply marvelous!!! At the end of both tours, he simply just let us soak it all by playing some of his favorite blues music that really made the whole experience enjoyable and memorable! Some Chucky Berry, Elvis, Dixie Cups, and some local blues! Thank you Madison! I'll be back and I'll specifically ask for you!"", ""After some research, I chose this company (over the larger ones) to take a tour of Oak Alley and the Laura Plantations. There were 12 people total on the tour with us. I felt a little bad for the last people who were picked up because it was not easy to get to the back of the van. But it seemed like everyone forgot about that quickly once we were on the road to the plantations. I chose the Oak Alley and Laura tours - Oak Alley is the most famous one and Laura has a fantastic tour. You do get to see a couple more plantations on the ride, but they are really just scenery. Our guide did speak a lot about local history on the way to the plantations and played music that related to what he was talking about. They also had some literature that they passed around that gave a good overview of Louisiana history.\n\nAt $70, it is quite a bit more than just driving out to Old River Road yourself, but if you want to really soak it in, you owe it to yourself to pay for a tour.

The egg pudding had enough sweetness in it that I didn't really need the latte to be super sugary. I liked the roasted tea flavor and it was a good drink for a hot summer night.

All kidding aside for just a second, the dining experience at Maico is decidedly unsophisticated.  Indeed, I was quite drawn to the rustic feel of the place:  there is no indoor dining per se.  One reviewer characterized this situation thusly:  ""Maico:  eat with flies.""  They do, however, have plenty of tables and chairs in a patio area.  And when I say patio, I mean the patio of a former home.  So on top of having to eat al fresco, you literally have to order at what used to be a window.  \n\nSeriously, take a second from being enraptured by this review to look at the nearest window on your home, apartment, or other dwelling and imagine it without any sort of glass.  Then look around your living space and kitchen and imagine it converted to one big cooking area devoted to making Mexican food.  Finally, picture that food being produced being pretty damn good.  Now snap back to reality and continue with my review.  \n\nLike you, I\'m sure, when I first heard of Maico, I was like ""WTF, what the hell is Maico?""

He apparently sampled the birria, or goat stew.  A few weeks ago, I happened to drive by the place on my way to a friend\'s.  I was hungry and decided to make a spontaneous stop. \n\nIn all honesty, I\'ve only been here once and ordered just three tacos.  Like any good, self-respecting taqueria, the carne asada was seasoned well, cooked properly, had fresh condiments including salsa with a nice bite, and tasty flour tortillas.  I also had one aforementioned birria taco.  That, too, was made properly.  You could tell that it took hours to cook, as the goat was very tender and effused with spices and chili.  The three tacos were washed down with the required Mexican soda.  I caught glimpses of dishes from other patrons, and it all appeared tasty, so I will make plans in the future to try some non-taco items.  \n\nThe food there undoubtedly was good.  Judging from my wise-cracking comments earlier about the ambiance of Maico, I truly don\'t have a problem with eating outdoors.  In fact, I would say that the majority of places in town that serve the best tacos don\'t have indoor seating.  In fact, tacos in Mexico are quintessentially a street food made and eaten on the street with the flies and whatnot.  \n\nThough I don\'t think many streets in Mexico matches the beauty, character or liveliness of our little 22nd Street.', ""Ordered on the phone for carry out while on the road to Dallas from Phoenix.

The salsa packs a sweet-hot punch, and the sonoran dogs are gooey wonders. They've forgotten a couple of ingredients in my orders before (cheese and sour cream was missing in my last Texano) but we've never regretted a stop here and the service is professional and friendly.

I got the estimate, which I thought was a little high, but admittingly, I know very little about cars.  I reluctantly gave them the go-ahead.  It was not the original reason I brought the car in but whatever, I was tired of riding around with coolant in my jeep.  \n\nThe car was fixed on time and I haven't had a problem with the radiator since.  The price was on the high side.  I figured it was just uptown New Orleans pricing.  My buddy who is a mechanic said Kehoe added a charge of replacing the coolant which he thought was superfluous.  He said that the coolant change is automatic anytime you replace a radiator.  He implied they tacked on a few services that should be built into any radiator replacement.  Not sure, but most opinions agree, the amount I paid for the radiator replacement was high...not outrageous but high.  That being said, the people were nice.  My car was fixed in a timely fashion.

Only a handful of reviews but, they\'re all excellent. I knew I had to get in ASAP as my home done haircut is... well, it\'s not ideal.\nAs soon as I walked in I thought I\'d hit the jackpot. And I did. It was a brief wait and I observed 4 barbers, really executing their skills so smoothly.  As one barber would finish a cut they\'d say, ""Who\'s next?!"" Next gent would hop up. \nIt\'s seriously the only time I\'ve ever thought any of these people could cut my hair and it would look great. \nI sat down, briefly explained what I wanted happening with my hair and fifteen minutes later I was done. \nLooking forward to heading back here in the future for sure!', 'I needed a quick haircut for an event and my usual spot was booked, so I was recommended to this place by a friend. The shop itself is nice and I went in having pretty high hopes just based off the looks. The prices listed were really reasonable ($20 for a haircut). I even thought I might start coming to this place regularly. Unfortunately, the haircut was one of the worst I had ever gotten. \n\nThe barber had the chair turned from the mirror the entire time so I was not able to really check it out until I got into the car after the fact. I immediately noticed that he had completely forgot to trim the side burns on the one side of my head and it was probably 2inches longer than the one he had cut. I then kept looking at it and found other issues with it being uneven on the top. At that point I was annoyed, but I did not want to go back in to get it fixed as I lost all confidence. \n\nI then got back on yelp and called the first barber that popped up. They had an opening right away so I went over there and got it fixed. I told the barber the situation and he started looking at my hair and began to laugh. That\'s how bad it was. He then showed me the back of my head which I had not seen at this point and it was completely uneven as well! I couldn\'t believe it. (side note: he didn\'t even shave my neck with the straight razor like every other barber i had been too before) \n\nI texted my buddy asking why he sent me to that place. He then asked who cut my hair and I told him and he said ""oh don\'t ever go to him. he is terrible. but everyone else is good."" I wish he would\'ve told me that beforehand as I would\'ve requested someone else.\n\nThey are also cash only which I didn\'t see posted anywhere when I walked in (I always look because I never carry cash). When I went to pay I didn\'t have cash, so I had to walk to the 7-11 a few doors down and use the ATM, which is more inconvenient than anything. I don\'t get why places are still cash only this day in age. For that reason alone I might not have gone back, even if the haircut had been good. \n\nOverall, it was a bad experience. Granted, it may have just been that one barber who was bad, but to me it\'s not worth the risk or the inconvenience of having to go elsewhere after and pay to get it fixed.', 'Men\'s clubs is the tits, plain and simple.

Sometimes I wish that hubby would open a Yelp account as he was thrilled with Las Cazuelas. \n\nMichael had a huge plate of three large enchiladas, substituting ground beef for the chicken and asking for the mole sauce to be on the side. The mole sauce was amazing, I\'m not surprised that it has won awards and I dipped my everything in it! His meal came with a nice sized portion of black refried beans and ""Mexican rice"", nothing like a Spanish rice, very plain, no onions or peppers, yellow rice.\n\nI could not get past the list of appetizers, so I ordered three as my meal, oh shush...  Queso fundido, which means melted cheese, not, it was one big blob of cheese, nothing dippy or stringy about it, hardened within seconds and it would have taken a knife and fork to cut it and it was not blended with the extra additions of chorizo and mushrooms, but was swimming in a spicy and extremely greasy sauce and served with three tortillas, to do what with, ugh, I have no clue. I packed this up to take home and try to melt, which it refused to do and I kept thinking, imagine what that would do to my arteries, so I chucked it. I guess I could have pretended it was string cheese and sliced it and ate it cold in its hardened form.\n\nThe guacamole ranchero was good, nothing special, I\'ve had much better guacamole and chips, but it was satisfying, although a very small portion. The shrimp ceviche was very enjoyable, again, a small portion for the price. I also had a side dish of refried beans, that I asked to be topped with lots of raw onion and cheese and I really did like this dish.\n\nI checked out their brunch menu which is very enticing and I would love to return with gung ho hubby to indulge in this.', ""It's really sad because 2 days ago this place would have gotten 4 stars from me. While the service is often disappointing the food is usually delicious and, as a local, I was quickly becoming a regular. I would have come to this restaurant without any deals but they are always on groupon or something similar so, we of course use those when we can. My mom, knowing I was a fan, purchased one for my fiancé and I as well as one for herself.\n\nLast night she decided to come in for dinner and was excited to try it here. As we both had the groupon and it was expiring soon she called ahead, TWICE, to ask if we could both use it. The girl who answered claimed she spoke to the owner and as long as we got separate checks it was fine. She drove in from NJ. Upon arrival our waiter told us he couldn't take the groupons, despite my mom's calls. We were disappointed and after discussing with him, he agreed that as long as we did separate checks it would be fine. We even made an effort to separate our tables to make the waiter more comfortable. We had a good meal, the food took a long time to come out and didn't come out at once but otherwise everything was good. My step dad was ready to tip our waiter very generously for being so accommodating.\n\nThe waiter returned to drop our two SEPARATE checks and informed us that he was sorry but could in fact only take one groupon. Really? So we were lied to not once, but twice. For the sake of $13 this restaurant lost 4 patrons, 2 of which were quickly becoming regulars and recommending it to everyone.

We wandered in on a Saturday night after waiting forever and a day elsewhere with no success. Somehow things magically worked in our favor and we were able to get a table within 10 mins despite it being so busy!\n\nI love being able to take my taste buds on a mini international flight. The small dishes (think tapas style) here each have a creative flair and you seriously can't go wrong with the variety of selections (gluten free and vegan friendly dishes are available too). We started off with the blue cheese stuffed dates which came out wrapped in glorious, smoky BACON with a balsamic reduction sauce(4/5). Sweet, savory and cheesy flavors were all wrapped in freaking BACON- how can you not devour such deliciousness?! It was a little too sweet for me personally. Next up was the Italian baked mac and cheese. This was the adult amped up version of mac and cheese- the creamy and cheesy goodness combined with the subtle crunch of the herbed bread crumbs was sheer deliciousness (5/5). The last dish of the night was the steak and cake (5/5). The all natural hangar steak was cooked to a perfect, juicy medium rare, resting atop a fresh Louisiana crab cake, with micro greens and béarnaise sauce. Everything in this steak dish had intense flavors and went very well together. You won't have to worry about leftovers because everything was happily and quickly devoured. Live music just made our dinner experience all the more amazing, along with our perfectly crafted drinks. At times, the music was loud, but music was meant to be shared and appreciated all over the world! \n\nI have to give a shout out to our hardworking server that night- he was swamped but managed to maintain his composure and provide quality service throughout the night. The restaurant is small but who doesn't mind cozying up to your SO or date in close quarters? Each staff member we interacted with was friendly and welcoming. For reference, you can make reservations in advance to avoid waitlist hassles.\n\nIf you find yourself in search of incredi-mazing food on Frenchmen Street, then you can count on Three Muses for a foodie-tastic culinary trip around the world to stimulate your palates.

Madly...  I haven't felt this way about any city in a long time.  Especially, in the US.  Maybe it was the music, the people, the beautiful streets.  Maybe it was because I got to experience it with someone I love.   Whatever it was, I know I'll be back.  As soon as I can.\n\nThe Man and I were strolling along in the French Quarter taking in all the sounds and smells of history.  The warm southern air makes time stand still.  We did a quick search for a casual place to rest our feet and feed on some local fare and found this gem called Three Muses.  The sounds of piano keys and voices led us in.  After being seated, we quickly ordered cocktails and a plethora of food.  It was amazing.  To have this kind of food at a gastropub, left me in awe.  Rosemary infused cashews, oysters, sliders, and everything you can imagine was all so incredibly delicious. \n\n\nThree Muses defined New Orleans for me.  Musicians playing with their hearts, great food prepared by people who care,strong, tasty cocktails in an unpretentious environment, relaxed people, smiling and enjoying the moment.

Add me to your long list of fans, Three Muses! \n\nWhen you think about it, they could probably get away with serving less than fantastic food. Many venues do! Three Muses puts as much attention and love into their food and drink as they do their bookings and this is how they are in a league of their own. Each time I've been here, I've been pretty blown away by what I've ordered (last night's tofu bulgogi being the best of the best!) Don't be deceived by a modest-sounding menu. The plates are small, but contain mucho deliciousness. You know what they say about too much of a good thing, right? That said, this is the kind of place you don't come starving after not eating all day (like last night). Besides the flavorful and light bulgogi, I also dig the edamame which comes in sesame oil. Falafel balls are amongst the best I've had, however I think they could use a lot more tahini (unless it was left off by accident. I couldn't taste any).\n\nCocktails. Last night's drinks were both a hit and a miss for me. The absinthe drink is described beautifully on the menu but the flavors described just did not come through.

Each time I've been, I enjoyed the acts immensely. You'll get the quintessential jazz club experience. \n\nService is friendly and if the bartender is able, will keep coming back to check on your table if you need drinks. A personal preference would be to have full table service, as I don't like ordering at the bar. Since they don't do separate checks, this requires one person from your party to go up and give in your entire order. It's just awkward if you're with more than one other person. That's about the only thing that makes this four instead of five stars for me. \n\nBonus points, however, for that awesome blonde gal working the door and seating your party!""]",0.4,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.4,1.0,30.0

I only have time for one massage on my 3,000 mile, cross country road trip, so it is extra important that it is nothing short of epic."" \n\nNot only was it not epic, I almost got up towards the end and walked out.

For wich her reply was, ""Oh, are you a runner?"" ... um what.\n\nSo what did I get? 15 minutes of work on my back, where I immediately asked her to use more pressure, because in her words exactly, ""I work on athletes and have a one to 10 scale of pressure so let me know if I should increase or decrease my force."" \n\n""What pressure are you at now?"" I asked.\n\n""Four."" I heard.\n\n""Can you please just go a LOT harder, please?""\n\n""Oh well im still warming you up because the warmer your muscles, the deeper I can go.""\n\nSo I waited. And waited. Had she spent the whole time on my back, slowly increasing pressure and making me ""hurt"" like she had bragged about, there would be no issue.  Instead, I got 45 minutes of getting my knuckles cracked, wrists pulled out of socket, (wich has left me with arthritic type pain in my fingers for the last few days) calf squeezing,  elbows repeatedly pushing hardly on my spine, extra long fingernails digging deep, and most annoyingly,  my pecs focused on for far too long... like literally 10 minutes.

The portion was just right, in fact, because the food was rich, you'll get easily stuffed. \n\nI don't know how we did it but trying BRENDAN's BREAD PUDDING ($8) was the very 2nd reason (next to the shrimp and grits) why we booked a table at Luke's.

But I think what allowed hoagies (or subs, grinders, whatever you want to call them) to survive is that they also taste great.\n\nI can say that a hoagie is one of my favorite meals. It is a perfect culmination of bread, meats, cheeses, veggies, vinegar, oil and spices and has been embraced worldwide as a lunch (or donner) favorite. Ricci's do hoagies right and as it continues to get handed down through the generations, I hope that they continue to flourish.\n\nSo, after over a hundred years, the community still loves Ricci's and after eating here, you will understand why. My go-to hoagie has always been an Italian and they do their Italian right. It is a substantial meal at a fair price and it is something that you will return to Ricci's again and again for.\n\nAs Ricci's enters into their second century, they still produce an outstanding product. With them continuing to do so, I can see them making it another century and beyond."", ""When my bathroom ceiling fell in for the third time in my old apartment, I had a nice chat with the guy who came to fix it. Marc grew up in South Philly and gave me a ton of recommendations on where to get a good bite to eat in the 'hood. You guessed it: among his recommendations was Ricci's. I was eager to try their sandwiches, but they were closed both times I tried to go (their hours are kind of unfortunate). Yesterday, I finally made it there (after making a pit-stop at CVS to hit the ATM, since they're cash-only) with my two friends who were visiting from Jersey. \n\nThe lines weren't too long; I'd say we waited for about three minutes to order. They have an assembly line of sorts behind the counter consisting of four or five Italian guys, a few of whom I'm assuming were Riccis. I ordered a Honey Turkey hoagie (I don't think you get to choose a size... they're all foot-longs) with lettuce, sweet peppers, onions, provolone, and it was assembled with lightning speed. They wrapped up my hoagie and my deli pickle (only $1 for the biggest pickle ever) and handed it to the cashier, where I was rung up promptly and with a smile. \n\nWe took our hoagies and chips home and proceeded to eat them almost as quickly as they were made. We were not disappointed. Although I still prefer Salumeria hoagies, I will definitely be back for another visit in the near future."", 'Welcome to South Philly. We do a lot of things poorly, some ok, and just a few perfectly. On that short list of perfection is Ricci\'s hoagies. \n\nI have traveled most of the country, and nowhere can you get a hoagie (ahem, ""sub"") like this. The place is, as noted by other reviewers, small and kinda strange. There is zero flash to this spot. You literally walk up to a guy at a deli slicer and order your pleasure, he slices the cold cuts and cheese, sends it to another person who puts toppings on (lettuce tomato onion pickles peppers and a whole host of others) and then hands it to you. \n\nI have had just about everything on the menu, from the Italian to the American to the tuna. My personal favorite is the roast beef. Rare and sliced thin, it is perfection on a bun. \n\nThis place is invaluable to Philly.

Yesterday at this location was the only waxing experience I\'ve come away from feeling insulted, weirdly shamed about my body, embarrassed, and honestly angry.\n\nIt started off with the waxer making small talk about being from a local town and me mentioning that I knew more Latinos who were moving out there and the waxer saying yea, it\'s getting ""worse and worse."" Then, when I stripped down for my Brazilian, she stared at me and asked ""love what IS that"" about some inner leg chafing I had. Sorry, guess you\'ve been skinny as a twig your whole life and never had this happen, but also you\'re a freakin waxer who sees all kinds of women naked all the time so how is that possible? Mind you, I am not even a big girl--I wear a size 8-10 in pants. But I\'ve never been skinny and always had thick thighs.\n\nI tell her oh, it\'s probably just chafing. She says, but those are like open sores. I was taken aback. I told her, I guess you\'ve never had thick thighs and gotten chafing? She goes ""oh sure, but you know, this is Philly so you never know, can\'t be too careful!"" And tells me no waxer is going to touch that and that she doesn\'t want to get in trouble.\n\nThis girl was really standing there and trying to hint to me that she thought I had an STD that I was asking her to touch just because I had some chafing. Not only is it one of the most ignorant things I\'ve ever heard (did you ever take Sex Ed, gf? That is not what any STD looks like) but I don\'t understand how this woman is in the business of regularly seeing naked women\'s bodies and has that little frame of reference for skin reactions that can happen on different kinds of bodies.\n\nTo make matters worse, she kept saying, ""Girl, you\'ve got a lot of hair,"" 3 or 4 times while waxing me. Girl I\'m aware, why do you think I\'m here? It comes off like you\'re just so irritated at all these obstacles I\'m asking you to deal with on my body. And I\'m paying for this? It\'s insulting.\n\nI\'ve worked in customer service, as a waitress, for years. I NEVER leave Yelp reviews because I know how unfair they can be--that sometimes things happen as a customer service professional that affect the client\'s experience but are frankly out of your control, and reviews can have a disproportionate affect on your job or the business you get. But this was just terrible and ignorant customer service and I really wonder how this woman talks to other people when they put their naked bodies on her table, because as a white-privileged, cisgender, relatively thin, able-bodied woman, my body isn\'t even that outside of what\'s considered ""normal"" and she still showed a remarkable amount of ignorance and fear towards it.\n\nAs a side note, I scrolled through these reviews and didn\'t get a good vibe from the business owner\'s response to the woman below with the burnt lip. Sometimes these big businesses make public replies to Yelp reviews and you get the sense that they\'re more interested in letting other readers know that they addressed it than in actually righting the wrong with the original customer.

So all the way back I went. Just to be told I should ""stay hydrated"" and use aloe. Great advice that was definitely worth the trip back for. I asked if they had aloe to give me - of course they did not. \n\nThen they asked to take pictures of my lip for training purposes. Since I wasn\'t humiliated enough. Super glad I\'m able to help them out with training. It\'s clearly needed. \n\nThey refunded the $12 wax, but not the tip I left (???). I used that $12 and more to instead buy aloe and vitamin e oil to treat the damage they caused. \n\nI woke up today and it looks even worse.

This isn\'t the museum\'s fault and it probably isn\'t worth the money to staff someone to watch this, but there is a young baby/toddler section so they don\'t get run over. My son almost got jumped on by children who looked over 5 years old in the mini ball pit. All the young children were just hanging out there barely moving and some older children came jumping. Maybe they were kids with younger siblings so the parents wanted them all in the same place, but it was in no way ideal. I\'m still happy that they have this little section, I just wish it was policed more. \n\nThe ""sandy"" area is pretty neat. It\'s not really sand, but more like super tiny rubber pieces.

I\'ve had epic nights, and mellow night, dead nights, and nights were I couldn\'t even get past the bouncer. Most these nights are weekend nights, and I\'ve yet to find myself Sainting it up on a weekday. \n\nHeads up: We all know there are New Orleans bars that your 17 year old cousin that looks like she\'s maybe 19 1/2 can get into by batting her eyes at the bouncer and passing back IDs. Not this one. Don\'t even try. This bouncer is stone cold. Walk away. \n\nI\'ve been to The Saint during epic techno parties during the witching hour where it had to have been 30 degrees outside, 98 inside, and a gentlemen in a purple mohair jacket owned the dance floor. Make sure you\'re good and drunk for the late night scene or else your sense of smell with slap you silly and your hearing with give out. \n\nI\'ve been there, and discovered the amazingness that is their patio with an outdoor bar, quite possibly just as large as the bar, though I actually can\'t tell how large the bar truly is due to lighting and poor eye sight. I really enjoy the patio for an Uptown afterwork scene. Next time, I\'ll snap a pic! \n\nI\'ve also been there during weird middle lulls between when everyone who came after work has moved on to their second bar around 9:30/10ish and the after midnight crazy hasn\'t started yet. The Saint isn\'t a place you can do a drive-by and figure if it\'s ""poppin\'"" or not, you\'ve got to go into the belly of the beast. \n\nAnother Yelper was spot on about the bathroom; one of my lesser favorite Hobbit hole sized ladies rooms in town so bring your hand sani and hover. \n\nI would definitely suggest you spend some time on their patio to see how much more this place has to offer.

Visitors actually need to be escorted in by a licensed tour guide. Whaaa? Really?? That\'s because the cemetery has been subject to much vandalism over the years and the church just got tired of cleaning after it. Once again our ""tour group"" ended up just being the three in my party so we kinda had a personal tour which was nice. Odile, our tour guide was very informative and entertaining...\n\nHighlights:\n\n1) St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 is the burial site of voodoo queen Marie Laveau. People aren\'t supposed to but they come and leave offerings for the voodoo mistress (see photo). Why the hair ties? Visitors dropped hair accessories near her grave... Marie Laveau was also a hairdresser.\n\n2) For the love of NOLA. I asked if there were any celebrities buried here. She said ""not yet"" as she proceeded to lead us to the plot for Nicolas Cage, who is still alive and well today. The Oscar-winning actor loves New Orleans and Louisiana. His tomb is shaped like a pyramid, perhaps from his movie ""National Treasure."" There\'s no name on it yet but it has the Latin words ""Omnia Ab Uno"" on it, which translates to ""Everything From One."" Also, while the actor\'s 2 properties in New Orleans were foreclosed the government didn\'t take away his tomb. \n\n3) First ever I\'ve heard of ""Social Tombs."" We saw social tombs for Portuguese, Italian and even a musician\'s social tomb. You could choose to be buried with other strangers if you\'re on a budget or if you\'re family couldn\'t afford your own tomb.\n\n4) The cemetery is tiny and crowded, not much bigger than a square block and tombs are above ground which New Orleans cemeteries are famous for. The vaults are laid out like little houses in mazelike aisles that feel like tiny streets. Many are surrounded by black iron fences, like they have private front yards or something.\n\n5) ... but why are the burial vaults built above ground?? It was explained to us because of the high water table and flooding, and because it was a European cultural custom.\n\n6) Pictures were allowed in the cemetery but we can\'t film or take videos. But why??? Blame it on actors Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda from the film ""Easy Rider."" There was a scene where they dropped acid while cavorting with women. The scene was shot without permission and led the church to ban filming in the cemetery! Gee thanks, Dennis and Peter. Btw, they used the Italian Benevolent Society tomb as a back drop. I have a photo of that social tomb. Yikes! \n\n7) So they have a weird system for the dead. After being buried the deceased would reside there for a year and a day, before being deposited in the basement, after being effectively cremated naturally in the hot climate.\n\nThe tour was about an hour long but it was one of my favorite thing we did. We love the mystery of a cemetery! Thanks to our fantastic tour guide! \n\nReview #1718', ""A historic cemetery with lots to see and learn. A few years back this one was open to the public. Now it's only open for tours at about twenty per person. This because of vandalism in the cemetery and the tix costs go to repairs and upkeep. \n\nInside you'll see mostly above ground tombs. There is a small area in the back for Presbyterian graves and those are below. A couple of noteworthy graves are Marie Louveau, aka the voodoo priestess. Also Nicolas Cage had a pyramid shaped grave here for when he passes away. \n\nTours are 45 min and fill you in on the history of the burial styles and different types of graves you'll see. Be sure to bring water with you as there is no shade here so you'll wanna keep hydrated. Sunblock isn't a bad idea either! \n\nOverall: A\nGreat way to learn a unique piece of the cities history."", ""It is the oldest and most famous cemetery in New Orleans, established in the late 1700's, now a top tourist attraction, the Voodoo priestess Marie Laveau is believed to be interred in the Glapion family cryp, and actor Nicolas Cage purchased a pyramid shaped tomb as future final resting place.

We barely made a dent on the nachos because we ate almost all the jalapeno cornbread. The jalapeno cornbread was the best of all four snacks/appetizer we ordered. It was so moist and flavorful with a side of sweet honey butter. The chicken tenders were thin cut and battered and dry. The fries that came with it didn't taste that great either. It taste like it been fry and was left in the warmer too long before being served. The mac & cheese skillet was ok, we both agreed the pasta would taste better if it was soft. I would definitely  come back for more jalapeno cornbread and the nachos. Our server Mike was so helpful and friendly, asking if everything was ok everytime he passes by.

But thanks for stopping by Yelp anyway  :)\n\nBut if you're even a little bit curious about going to a shooting range, or you're a seasoned pro, I highly recommend you check out the Philadelphia Archery & Gun Club. I went with a friend of mine who is a gun owner and has been there before and another friend who, like me, was a first timer. From the moment we walked in the door the staff was friendly and professional. Admittedly, I was a little weirded out by all the gun stuff, but hey, I WAS in a shooting range, so I knew I'd be seeing firearms. My friend and I signed a waver, we all three showed our licences, and then went upstairs to the range. It is a very safe facility and you have to go through multiple doors to end up in the shooting range itself.\n\nOnce upstairs, we were given earphones, safety glasses, a target and oh, yeah, bullets. Gulp. This was the real deal. I was actually going to shoot a gun. I think I got a little sweaty and my industrial goggles actually fogged up.\n\nWe went through another 2 sets of doors and then there we were, gun, bullets and all. After a lesson on loading it and proper etiquette (bottom line - don't point it at people and don't be a spazz) I stepped up to give it a try. \n\nFirst things first - if you've never shot a gun or heard one before (like me) it's extremely surprising how damn loud it is (ohh, THAT'S why you wear earphones). And the kickback on the gun (I was shooting a Glock) was unexpected, too. Oh yeah, be prepared for shells to fly, which takes a little getting used to.\n\nThe first shot was really, really scary. The second, a little less so. And by the third, well, I was totally into it. I emptied one clip and my friend took her turn (hopefully she will Yelp about it, too). And then I had one last try before I had to get back to my regularly scheduled life. My grand finale involved emptying a round into the target of a 70's dude who looked a little like Ron Jeramy. It was crazily satisfying and I left feeling very empowered. And, believe it or not, I was actually pretty good at it.\n\nThere was an instructor (Bobby) who was on hand to answer our questions and show us proper positioning so we didn't slice our thumbs off. And the fee that we paid when we left was incredibly reasonable for 20 minutes of feeling like a badass.\n\nI'm never going to own a gun and I'm not interested in ever shooting anything outside the walls of a shooting range. But I am almost certain that I'll be back, because this was an experience unlike anything else I've ever done before."", 'I really enjoy squeezing off a few rounds from a pistol, or even better, an AK-47, on an otherwise quiet Sunday afternoon, and what better place to indulge this hobby than at the Philadelphia Archery & Gun Club located right by the Italian Market in Bella Vista? \n\nFor anyone who has been to other gun clubs in the Philadelphia area, it\'s not uncommon to overhear conversations rife with overt hatred for ""bleeding heart liberals"" or, prior to his presidency, see targets with Obama\'s face, head wrapped in a turban. Places like that are disconcerting and just not fun. You won\'t find this attitude at SPAG. \n\nThe staff and clientele at this club come from a diverse background and share only one thing, a love of firearms and target shooting. No political agendas here. I\'ve found the staff extremely helpful in asking questions about different firearms or potential purchases, and they\'re always willing to suggest a new rental option for you to try. \n\nBest of all, they let you shoot some pretty high-powered stuff here. No automatics, and no 50 caliber sniper rifles, but otherwise, it\'s pretty free reign. The only downside is that there are only a handful of lanes, and at peak times, you might have to wait a bit to shoot, but I\'ve never waited more than 30 minutes, and there\'s no time limit on how long you occupy a lane. For members, lanes and targets are free, so the only thing you\'ll ever really need to buy are the bullets. \n\nIf you\'ve never fired a gun before, this is the place to visit. They\'ll get you set up with what you need and you\'ll feel right at home. After you work up an appetite blasting paper men and rescuing hostages from the 1980s, grab a bite at the Italian Market. I always go for the great tacos at La Veracruzana at 9th & Washington.', ""I had an incredibly frustrating experience here. I've waited a couple weeks to make sure I'm writing it with some objectivity. Long story short, the owner refused to sell me a gun because I have bad handwriting. I'm not sure if I should ever go back.\n\nI'd been there a few times in the past with a friend. They have a good location, and a pretty good setup. The staff had always been friendly and attentive.I went again this weekend for their annual Springfield day. An XDM has been on my wishlist for a while now, so I was looking forward to trying and buying one. Initially, it was a pretty positive experience. I signed up for a membership at a special price, less than the cost of 6 sessions at the non-member cost. I tried out a few different pistols. Upstairs in the range, the RSOs moved people through quickly, but still took the time to give me tips loading the magazine, which was a bit trickier than the revolvers and .22s I'm used to. Ammo prices were reasonable, though due to the crowd they were only selling a half box at a time. Then I went to the sales counter and asked about buying an XDM40.\n\nThis is when the trouble started. As I began filling out the transfer form, the owner said I wasn't writing clearly enough. I'll be the first to admit that I have atrocious handwriting, but this is a form that gets filled out leaning on waist level counters in shops like this, or on any available surface at gun shows. He told me to start over and to write carefully.  I was now running late to meet friends for lunch and a concert, but started the form anew and tried to take my time. I finished the forms, the salesman looked them over, and called in my background check. Everything seemed fine until I got to the owner at the register and he started reading it over. He got really agitated and very critical of my handwriting. I did my best to stay calm and ask what my options were. He just kept complaining about my forms. I told him I was running late, and asked if I should put down a deposit to come back and try the form again, or if I should just go. After asking that 3 times while he continued to berate me about the form, he conceded and told me to come back the next day.\n\nWhen I showed up the next afternoon, the salesman remembered me, and said the owner told him not to sell to me if I came back. I was pretty incredulous, but he and another employee just deflected that it was the owners discretion. I asked for a refund on my membership, since I had no reason to use it, and they did. I understand that selling guns is a regulated business, but the situation just felt absurd. It's a handwritten form filled out on the fly, surely they make some effort to deal with handwriting issues when the forms are processed. They even took a photocopy of my Drivers license and credit cards, and I had offered a passport card for further verification.\n\nIt's a shame, because until I dealt with the owner, the staff had been great, and it's a very convenient range for me. Even dealing with the other staff after being denied the purchase was cordial and professional. Every other time I'd been there it was positive, but now I'm not sure if I'm ever going back.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,

I said I wanted to get my nose pierced and they said they were going to finish their cigarettes and to go wait inside. *Sigh*....so that isn\'t the biggest deal in the world, I get it..you\'re on a smoke break, however--they were just so blah and unfriendly when they said it that I was a little put-off. \n\nSo I wait inside for about 10 minutes while they shoot the breeze outside.

He quickly pierced me and then sent me on my way without giving me cleaning instructions. \n\nDespite all of this, I still tipped him. When I tipped him, he seemed genuinely surprised and immediately became much more friendly. Maybe what  happens is that, since this place is on the outskirts of the Quarter and open late, they get in a bunch of drunk tourist customers who don\'t tip and, because of this, are a bit disenchanted with their job.

If 4 customers came in, 1 would have to wait outside. \n\nThankfully the girls behind the counter, although teenagers, are extremely sweet and helpful.

I was happy with all the pastries, especially the cinnabun, but I was so NOT happy with that butter cake! You see, I am a person that eats with my eyes, and this cake looks like the most boring, ugly pasty cake you will ever see. For a small baking plate (like where you would make 6 brownies) you pay $7 for a butter cake that is essentially a dry thin cake with a thick layer of butter and cream on top. The top part is a strange texture and wayyyy too sweet even for someone like me that loves sugar. I was extremely disappointed and threw out the entire thing after one bite (my beau did not care to even try it).\n\nNeedless to say, I am willing to try this place one more time to attempt one of these highly sought after cream donuts, but I\'m""m not exactly racing back.

We would take it home and then fight over who would get the center (and most gooey part) of the cake.  Thankfully even if you lost the battle for the center your consolation prize of either edge was still damn good.  I've heard many ravings about their cream donuts but for some reason I'm too dumb to ever get one because I see the butter cake and I just can't think straight.\n\nLast time I got a butter cake a few years back I was caught in a terrible traffic jam on 95 and I kept calling to tell them I was coming for that butter cake!

If you want to try something different the Chicken Avgolemono soup is really yummy, it's a ticker creamy lemon/chicken soup with orzo. You can never go wrong with the traditional or chopped salad... I would suggest ordering the small (the portion is massive).  I always order the gyro sandwich, which is packed full with lamb, onions and tomatoes slathered in tazziki.  \n\nI think a good indicator that you have landed on a good restaurant is the quality of their soda available on draft.

I couldn't believe it! I made it! It was so rewarding! This has been on my bucket list for more than a decade.\n \nPeople are right: the trail up to Seven Falls is pretty easy. \n \nIf you are a moderately fit adult -- and on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the most severe -- you'll find that the trail peaks out around 4. Mostly, that's when you're doing the switchbacks or if it is hot. \n \nHonestly, anything above 80° is likely going to be frustrating at least several times along the way. The key is to take your time.\n \nFor those of you who need a boost, consider paying a $3 fee to take the tram, which gets you very close to the trailhead.\n \nAlso important, water! I heard the recommendation is to bring 1 quart of water per person. That is a lie! I would say 1 gallon of water per person, and at a minimum during the warmer months. If you are hiking and it's more than 85° out, be sure to pack extra water. And a snack. I even saw several people hiking with Gatorade. And I saw even more people run out of water on the trail.\n \nThe hike is not treacherous, but it is fairly rocky off and on. Also, the further in you get in the harder it gets. And the steeper it gets. \n \nI cannot stress this enough: be very, very careful of wet rocks. There are many, many smooth, slippery rocks heading up to the falls and at the falls. We've had so many rescues this year already, and in years' past.\n \nAlso, don't forget your bathing suit! The reward at the end is more than ample.\n \nOne last thing: I met many wonderful people along the trail who helped to redeem my trust in humanhood.\n \nThese folks may never read this review, but in the style of Craigslist missed connections ads:\n \nTo the girl who gave me a high-five, onward and upward! \n \nTo the UA grad who now lives in Chicago and was on a visit, Bear Down!\n \nTo the woman heading down who learned that it was my first time making it to the falls and congratulated me, continue being beautiful!\n \nTo the lady who let me borrow her hat so I could douse myself in water, thank you for the brilliant idea.\n \nTo the couple who asked me if I knew anything about flowers, it was great seeing you at the end of the falls."", ""There are numerous trails you can take along Sabino Canyon. We took the trail that goes to Seven Falls after taking the shuttle. The shuttle has a ride I believe 1-2 times an hour on the half hour and is $6 per person that is round trip. You can pay by the machine or the driving can take card as well on the shuttle. \n\nFrom the shuttle stop to the falls are approximately 2.9 miles each way and is a nice little adventure. You have to go through the river numerous times throughout the trail and there are times you'll lose the trail and can't go wrong when you follow the river. \n\nDefinitely recommend it. And if you have time jump in the water a little. Might be the cleanest and is a bit on the chilly  side. But I've never really known of hot waterfalls \u200d.

My choice (and my hubby\'s) is Madre and for Chef John Chavez and his wife and co-owner Julie who have done such a good job of providing great food and responsible stewardship in these tough times of covid19 with ordered eatery closures and reopening. We especially appreciate them being nimble to include and expand convenient take out options for diners like those of us relying on that mode to both support what we think are the best in local eateries now so they will be with us \'then\' in the covid19 after times when we can go back to inside dining.\n\nA HO-HO-HOLIDAY NOTE:  Madre offered a menu for a Thanksgiving dinner to go.  They are going to offer a Christmas Dinner menu as well.  Check their website or FB page for details.  Or call 208.713.2707\n\nGREAT FOOD AND GREAT PEOPLE WITH DELICIOUS TAKE OUT OPTIONS FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE CHOOSING THAT IN COVID TIMES:  If you want to know more about the delicious food provided by Chef Chavez, a one time Beard nominee, and the grace filled hospitality managed by Julie, see my previous reviews.  In the meantime, I think they are open for inside dining following socially distanced rules (you will not find restauranteurs who are more focused on doing the right things) but if you are like my hubby and I are relying on ""to go"" the Chavez\'s make that very easy to do here.\n\nEASY \'HOW TO\' FOR \'TO GO\':  You can order in advance by calling the restaurant or by using the very easy TOCK interface on their website.   https://madrerestaurant.net/   Schedule a pick up time during their open hours (currently Wed - Sat / 3-7 but check their site or FB page since these have shifted over the months in adjustment to covid and diners).  They make pick up easy - schedule a time, pull up out front or at the side parking, call that you\'re there and they deliver to car or you can walk in to take away the hot order waiting for you.  \n\nThey offer take out from their menu and on some days (like Thu - Sat now) they offer a special ""family meal"" in sizes to serve 2 or 4. \n\nAlso, in response to customers who asked for it, they are now offering cold grab and go dishes like enchiladas so you can take them home to cook them later.\n\nMADRE FOOD TICKLES TASTEBUDS AND LIFTS SPIRITS: My hubby and I have enjoyed many great take out meals thanks to John and Julie Chavez that have kept us nourished in body and spirit during these challenging months.  For that we are most thankful.  We highly recommend them to everyone.', 'Madré Boutique Taqueria is a modern restaurant serving up Mexican-inspired food in an upscale environment. Located right by a collection of student apartments, Madré is clean, unique and is on it\'s way to be becoming a Boise must-try. \n\nMoving on, the primary focus is tacos, however they also offer other dishes including burritos and salads. On this visit I bellied up to the Carnitas Burrito (choice of black or pinto beans, rice, cheese, guacamole and salsa, $14.00) and a Lemonade Cider ($6.00) that I completely forget the brewer of to wash it all down. Overall, I enjoyed it but I can\'t say it was anything spectacular. It just tasted like any other carnitas burrito I\'d ever had from a taco truck, for double the price. I\'m okay with that, because you\'re paying for the in-dining experience as well as the food. It was generously large, filling up both my husband and I. I didn\'t quite enjoy the dipping sauce much either, next time I\'ll be sure to ask for Tapatio. The popular ""OG Crispy"" taco seems to be a hit. I saw several leaving the kitchen, after I had placed my order. It\'s basically a taco with crispy cheese blended to the rim, creating a piece that\'s very pleasant to look at. I\'ll make sure to order those next time, if I choose to return.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

We they invited me to go to dinner with them last night for her last night here and it was the worst experience at a restaurant ever. We are all three in the service industry and know that what we saw in that restaurant last night was unacceptable. \n\nWe waited about 10 min for a table which wasn't bad given how busy they were. They sat the three of us at an 8 top. Then they sat a couple at the same table with us without even letting us know we were going to be at a community table. It took ten min for our server to even greet us and that was AFTER he greeted the couple that was sat at our table AFTER us. And he told us he'd be right back after he put their order in!! He could have went ahead and got our order at the same time and put them both in. Just treat us as a 5 top instead of two separate tables. then he came back like five min later and took our order. We gave him everything, drinks, apps, entree's. Then we sat there for 30 more min without him ever even coming back to the table to soothe us. WE NEVER EVEN GOT DRINKS in that 30 min. I even asked for a water to go with my cocktail and wasn't even brought that. Apparently all the servers do not believe in saying a word to their tables unless they have something in their hand to offer them. Training is very much needed for these servers. \n\nAnd the bartenders were acting like they couldn't keep up. So our server was back behind the bar trying to make drinks (as were other servers) because the bar tenders weren't getting them made. And he wasn't doing it properly. We were watching him read the recipe from a card and pouring, not even using jiggers which is definitely a no-no if you aren't a bartender and know how much of something to pour. So you know the drinks were not consistent. And he was not using a strainer to pour the drink after shaking it. Then he just poured the drink from the shaker into a glass using the ice he shook it in!!!!so right there the drink was already dead. Then he sat the drinks aside and left them at the bar to deliver drinks to another two top that was sat long AFTER us. And their drinks looked dead as well. But how are you going to make our drinks then not bring them. It takes less than two minutes for a drink to die. \n\nFinally we were like at what point do we leave? It's been 30 min since he took our order and we don't even have drinks and when we do get them they are going to be dead and prob not even taste correctly because he was obviously not trained on making drinks. So we got up and left. \n\nAnd there was Not a single manager in sight. And servers or bussers had got off work and were sitting at the bar taking up space drinking in uniform smh. I'm a very good server and bartender I know the industry. That is not how you run a place. If you'd like, my friend and I can come back and consult and tell you exactly what you should do to turn the service around in that place. In fact my friend is going to come back and offer his service to you as he is literally the best server in the city and is a consultant for restaurants. \n\nOh and one more thing, you're using real candles on the tables rather than oil candles. The candles were scented which is a HUGE NO-NO! Nose receptors and taste buds are connected, that is why you can sometimes taste what something smells like. And also smells can alter the taste of food. So the scented candle would have ruined our meal should we have ever got to try the food. \n\nTo sum it up - we spent almost an hour there. Got there at 8:10 and left at 8:54, was addressed by our server twice, then never spoke to again, never got drinks let alone food.""]",0.4,0.0,0.0,0.6,0.0,1.0,30.0

Dale Mabry in the heart of Carrollwood last December. Like their sister restaurant along Boy Scout near the International Plaza Mall, McAlister\'s is a nice little deli franchise which started in Oxford, Mississippi in the late 80s, and has grown throughout the southern US since that time.\n\nThe menu is soups, salads, wraps, loaded baked potatoes and a wide variety of deli sandwiches. They had about half a dozen different types of soup (and chili) which could be served as stand-alone cups or bowls, or even as a side with your salad or sandwich. There were quite a few different entrée salads with a number of different salad dressings, and about 10 different types of loaded baked potatoes.\n\nAs for the sandwiches, McAlister\'s has several classic deli and vegetarian sandwiches, club sandwiches, hot sandwiches like melts, French Dips, Reuben\'s, and The Big Nasty. They also have grilled panini sandwiches including a four-cheese griller, a smoky pepper jack turkey, and the spicy southwest chicken griller served on a ciabatta roll.\n\nFor lunch I had the ""Choose Two"" option with a cup of soup and half of a sandwich. You could have also selected shareable nachos, half of a baked potato, or a salad. For a normal-sized sandwich, your choice of sides includes chips, potato salad, fruit cup, coleslaw, applesauce, pasta salad, steamed veggies, mashed potatoes & gravy, mac & cheese, or a cup of soup or a side salad for a slight upcharge. \n\nThis healthy lunch option was served quickly, and offered plenty of food for an affordable price.\n\nThis new version of the restaurant is surprisingly large, and  they kept the place very clean and organized. The cashier and servers were friendly, and they walked around offering free refills on the drinks which was nice. Prices are certainly in line with other delis in the area. I gave McAlister\'s an extra star for the diversity of foods on their menu, the cleanliness of the restaurant, and the friendliness of their staff.\n\nIf you have an office nearby they will also assemble some nice looking deli trays. They\'re open 7 days a week from 10:30 am - 8:30 pm.', 'This deli is order at the counter and issue an order number.  Then you a fix you number to table stand. That how they identify your order and deliver to you. Table and seat is pick by you. It has freedom of your table choice. I like that concept of fast food order. They bring the food to you. \n\nThe menu is very simple. Mainly is the sandwich. Nothing fancy. We got the Black Angus Beef Club. The club sandwich come as four pieces of bread cut in triangle with beef slide sandwich. The bacon can be improved to a bit crispy. This item may be one of the most expensive items. Taste is ok. \n\nWe waited about 8 minutes for our food to deliver to our table. Not much of service', 'Another quality location for this chain in the Tampa Bay Area that I first discovered in San Antonio, Texas almost two decades ago.\n\nThe vast selection of items speaks for itself and the spuds put them ahead of most other ""sandwich and more"" fast casual dining concepts.\n\nOver time, the spuds have become almost a must have on every visit because they are very filling and a great choice on the Choose 2 menu.\n\nTheir selection of soups also stands out to me over similar spots and I haven\'t found one yet that wasn\'t worth putting next to my spud of choice for that particular day.\n\nI will say that if you\'re in the mood for a sandwich, order it as a full size and not as a half or part of the Choose 2. Besides, you get a side item with the full size sandwich and the half is just not large enough on its own even with soup or salad in my opinion.\n\nAnother reason I like McAlister\'s is how the employees seem very relaxed and competent when taking orders, while also very open to questions and special requests. I\'ve always liked the overall attitude and they don\'t sweat small details and seem to want to make people happy with their orders. \n\nMaybe it\'s just me, but I seem to rarely get the forced ""Suggestive Sales Tactics"" from cashiers at McAlister\'s. And if they do ask if I want a drink, it is like they\'re just making sure rather than really trying to sell it to run up my bill.\n\nOh, and about half of you hate pickles, so you can be gone now. For the rest of us, don\'t you love how McAlister\'s has a huge bucket of pickles cut into quarters that customers can just take as they wish? I find this at a number of various places in Texas (Such as Twisted Root), which brings me back to where I first went to a McAlister\'s in 1998. It was really good on that San Antonio trip and still is now as they\'ve expanded into Florida.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

It is worth finding. \n\nThis is a vegetarian house.  Their menu consists of six pages of mostly Kerala delights, with a little other North and South India thrown in to keep it interesting and popular. It was a perfect place to settle down after excellent foot massage right up the road at Lavendar Spa.  \n\nWe shared these dishes: Sweet Corn Soup, Chili Pakoda, Kaju Curry, Vegetable Jalfrezi and Garlic Naan.  All were good to near excellent, except for the Masala Tea which was tasteless and disappointing. I love most forms of corn soup, and this was fairly standard. Sweet kernels with a light dusting of curry. Not sure if it came from a fresh ear of corn or a can, but it was still good.  The Chili Pakora was a nice surprise - Jalapeno peppers stuffed with mashed potato and spices, dipped in a heavy pakora breading and deep fried.  Very spicy and a strong nod to Indo-Mex cuisine.  The Kaju (cashew) Curry was a cool play on nuttiness in a mild, almost sweet pale orange curry.  Terrific. Perfect for sopping up with the Garlic Naan, which was more lightly tandoored than most I have eaten.  The texture was not heavy with oil nor garlic, despite its strong taste.  Very well done. Finally, the Veggie Jalfrezi provided a mix of mostly standard local green is a pleasant moderately heated curry.  We went with Level 5 on all dishes, except the Chili, and found it adequate for our tastes.  Regardless, some were hotter than others, but quite satisfactory across the board.  \n\nService was friendly and efficient, and prices on the pleasant side of reasonable. $44 for all the above four dishes, naan and tea.\n\nThere are several decent Indian kitchens in this area, and Taj should be on your list when in the neighborhood and in the mood for quality vegetarian meals.', 'This place was my first taste of Indian Food and has sparked an obsession in me. My friend and I came here and got to-go orders, but the interior here is clean and nicely decorated, I would definitely stay to eat in during another occasion. I order the vegetable curry and the garlic naan. Everything was amazing. The food is well prepared and so full of flavor! The spices all mix well together and not one of them overwhelmed the others. The naan was perfectly baked and a great addition to scooping up my curry. Portions here are huge and the lunch I ordered was enough for me to have a great dinner that night too.', ""Bhature. It's bread that they fry. Fried bread. FRIED BREAD. It happens to be absolutely delicious, too. Their other breads [naan, kulcha, etc] were good and to standards you'd expect from a good Indian restaurant. But that goddamn Bhature, I'll have that all day.\n\nLet me first say that it's very nice inside, feels upscale and is definitely a nice place to take someone out on a date. They even play Bollywood flicks on the TV there, great distraction if the date starts talking about the Kardashians or her ex, so just lose yourself in the food and 100 people dancing on the screen.\n\nOpened up with the Pakoda, and having been craving it since I last been to Zaika, it hit the spot. A plate of it is perfect for four, a bit overwhelming for two. Since I'm an eternal fatass, I polished it off, but it didn't leave much room for the dinner...\n\nWHICH WAS INCREDIBLE. It was the Paneer Bhurji, and it will go down as one of the most tasty items I've ever had at any Indian joint. The waitress asked what level of hot I wanted it at, and I foolishly said 10 at first, but quickly revised it to a 7 when I saw her next. The lady friend insisted a 5 was intolerable last time she ate here, so I moved the heat index accordingly from my understanding of her tolerance.\n\nGood move, the curry made me sweat, but didn't break me. BEAST MODE MOTHERFUCKERS. The great thing about food from this region is how exotic it is in comparison to the foods we eat here everyday, so it's a real treat when they take so much care in its preparation and the outcome is as bangin' as my dinner was.\n\nThe place is entirely vegetarian, so the dish consisted of grated cheese, onions, and bell pepper with their special dash of spices in a curry. Wholly unexpected was the awesome dish placed in front of me, and staring down a dish of rice [it's included] and a whole basket of nom-tastic Indian breads.

This is a BYOW restaurant which are immensely popular for those of us who want and like good food at reasonable prices and prefer to bring our favorite wine without the customary tavern markup, I wish more restaurants would consider this option.\n For starters we had grilled octopus which was extremely tender, grilled perfectly and served with olive oil, garlic and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar. Next came our cold mezze plate with Taramosalata (cavier dip), Skordalia( potato garlic puree), Melitzanosalata ( roast eggplant dip), Kopanisti ( spicy feta cheese), Hummus ( chickpea spread) and domades ( stuffed grape leaves), this cold mezze was excellent in many respects better than I have had elsewhere when dining Greek. For my main coarse, I order roast lamb which came with rice, potato and a mixed vegetable, the lamb was delicious and very tender looking more like pulled pork than  sliced lamb roast, no matter, the flavor was outstanding so to were the accompanying sides. Others ordered roast chicken; a combination plate of Greek sausage (Lukániko), meatballs (Keftedakia), pastitcio ( baked casserole of  ground meat, pasta with a Béchamel sauce). Everyone was very pleased with their choices and as you might expect we all shared as most foodies usually do, the chicken btw was bomb!\n For dessert and to share for our table, I ordered Kataifi ( a shredded philo dough baklava type sweet), Galaktoboureko ( layers of golden brown crispy phyllo, sprinkled with melted butter, filled with a creamy custard and bathed in scented syrup, personal favorite) and Revani ( a coarse semolina cake soak in simple syrup). All desserts were excellent and what one would expect when dining in an authentic Greek restaurant; the Galaktoboureko, well lets just say it was intergalactic! \n Zorba's is a family run business that has kept very close to Greek style family dining tradition this place does it extremely well and the table service is outstanding, Zorba's offers a dining experience you won't want to miss when you are in Philly."", ""Zorba's is hands down one of the best authentic Greek spots in Philly! I personally love to dine here al fresco when the weather is nice, but stepping inside being surrounded by photos of my favorite Greek islands isn't too shabby either. \n\nTheir Fisherman's Feast is a favorite with my crew. It includes generous portions of filet of salmon, tilapia and rainbow trout. It comes complete with incredible roasted potatoes, rice and delicious stewed veggies! It's really an entire platter easily split by two hungry folk or a few for grazing. Technically this dish is only available for dinner, but they recently catered to my table during lunch, so just ask! \n\nGyros are a specialty, and served traditionally like you find in Mykonos with fries inside! They are absolutely packed but only available for lunch. A fan favorite for sure! \n\nDon't forget the baklava! It's to die for here. Drenched in honey with perfectly crisp flaky layers. Oh em geeeeee!! Even if you're stuffed, take some to-go! \n\nStart with the roasted eggplant dip! It's heavenly. Heavy on the garlic, but oh so delish and served with perfect warm pita!!! (I'm a pita snob). Calamari is said to be a terrific starter as well. \n\nWhen I crave and miss Greece, which is very often, this is where I head. Everyone who has been to this Fairmount staple loves it, and everyone I take here for the first time does as well. A crowd pleaser for sure!\n\nIt's on the smaller side so larger parties may potentially be a bit of an issue, but call in advance if it's a special occasion. The family own joint is super accommodating and friendly. \n\nBring those bottles of unmistakable clean, refreshing Greek white or some Ouzo because it's BYO! \n\nParking takes a bit patience, but once you find a spot out front I believe it's 8 hours unmetered! Score!!"", ""I just ate the best Mediterranean delivery food of my life. I couldn't even wait until tomorrow to write this review, that's how good this was. Two reviews, one day-good. Okay, you get the point. \n\nI came across Zorba's on a delivery app and promptly checked out the Yelp reviews. Solid scores all around from my trusted peers. I love Mediterranean food and order it from various restaurants probably once a week. I've found most places to be meh/okay to good, at best. Nothing has blown me away. Until Zorba's. \n\nI ordered the chicken souvlaki platter which came with several skewers of chicken over seasoned rice, delicious roasted veggies and the best tzatziki I've ever had. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and shockingly tender. How did you do it, Zorba's?! I also ordered a side of hummus and asked for cucumber instead of pita. The biz owner called to double check if I still wanted the bread that came with the entree. I didn't, and appreciated his attention to detail. I received lots of sliced cucs and the hummus was great. \n\nZorba's is a wee bit pricier than some other Mediterranean delivery spots, so it will have to be a dinner delivery option, rather than lunch. But the food is well worth the cost. If a lunch menu ever becomes available I might just become their best customer!""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

The food and service was very good! \n\nI started by ordering a simple side salad. It was mixed greens, tomatoes, red onions, and cheese. It was super simple but so good. I had my salad with ranch dressing. This salad hit the spot.\n\nMy husband also had a drink from here. I don't remember the name but go look at my pictures. He said it was good and gave a slight buzz. It's a tall greenish drink! \n\nI ordered the Red Beans & Rice with a side of Jambalaya and my husband ordered the Southern Fried Fish Platter. The Red Beans and Rice came with creamy, slow-simmered red beans served with white rice, andouille sausage and gator sausage. This dish was good. I liked that they give you two different sausages. Both were good. One sausage was better than the other but I don't know which was which. My only complaint here is that the Red Beans could have used a tad more flavor. The Jambalaya was very good! It was seasoned well and was the best Jambalaya we had while being in New Orleans. Now let's talk about my husband's fish platter. It was served with french fries and hushpuppies with a side of cocktail and tartar sauces. Omg, this fish platter was sooo good! The fish isn't exactly catfish but in the catfish family or close to the waiter said. It was fried to the perfect golden brown. It was also seasoned well. It tasted wonderful with the cocktail sauce. Truly a good light fried fish. I hate food being fried hard! The hush puppies were the cherry on top! They were like a jalapeño hush puppy. They were so good, moist with a little kick. It went perfect with the fish! I really enjoyed helping my husband eat this. Lol. I know this sounds greedy. However sometimes if my husband and I want to try two dishes from a restaurant, I'll order one and he orders the other and we share both. It was probably some of the best fried fish I've ever had. I'm picky about fried fish so I don't order it a lot or eat everybody's.

Today was not the day to try this, but boy was I impressed! There was a cantonese twist on calamari and fried brie on the app menu. We went with the Famous Cheese & Ale Dip, well because it\'s famous. This was good stuff. They give you a lot of toasted ciabatta to dip in the cheese, so we brought half of it home. We wanted to make sure we had enough room in our tummies to try our entrees. \n\nI ordered The Bomb, which is a cheese burger with onion straws and bacon covered in pizza dough, then baked and served with a horseradish beer sauce on the side. I had to order this after realizing how different it was from your normal bunned burger. Our server also said that The Bomb was featured on Drive-ins, Diners and Dives with Guy Fieri at their other location (okay, so now I\'m aware that there\'s another location). I ordered it medium without bacon after asking my server if they were pre-made with bacon inside. She stated that everything is made to order, so I can definitely get it that way. I love the choice of sides that come with the burgers; fries (of course), white cheddar mashed potatoes, red beans & rice, soup or salad. I got the salad. I have to say I\'m even impressed with the house salad because most burger/wing/beer style establishments give you iceberg or romaine lettuce, but TBBC uses mixed greens and a citrus vinaigrette house dressing. I felt good eating this salad because I knew what was to come. So, The Bomb comes out looking ""the bomb""...enough for someone at a nearby table to ask what it was. However, I cut it in half only to find bacon intertwined with the melting cheddar. It looked soooo good, but anyone who knows me knows I won\'t willingly eat bacon if I don\'t have to. So, I sent it back and our server gladly replaced it. Before it arrived she told me they took it off the check, which was unnecessary because things happen, but this is how business should be run. When a mistake is made you offer to take it off or offer a freebie for your trouble. The server was even nice enough to ask me if I\'d like it boxed since hubbystanks finished his Tetanka (a bison burger) before I even finished my salad. I told her I\'d still eat part of my burger there, but I\'d need a box because after seeing the size of The Bomb I was pretty sure I would have left overs. They brought out the new Bomb (which even had fries on the side which I didn\'t need, but again a nice gesture). I cut into it. It was juicy, perfectly cooked and piping hot! Holy moly this was a damn good burger! It\'s a must to dip the burger in the horseradish Red-Eye Amber Ale sauce. I could only eat about 3 bites. Hubbystanks had to try it and he loved it too. Late night snacktime will be so tasty tonight.\n\nAll in all, I can\'t wait to come back. Some small details I noticed: The kitchen staff was dressed in black chef\'s coats This let me know I was getting something close to gourmet. I also noticed the attention to detail with our server. Not only was she extremely accommodating with replacing my order, but when we asked for to-go boxes we got the boxes, but didn\'t have to ask for sauce containers. This may seem small, but you don\'t know how many times I\'ve been given a box for something soupy. \n\nI highly recommend TBBC and hope that the customer service, cleanliness, laid back atmosphere and solid food stays up to par! Westchase needs this level of excellence in restaurants. I want to try everything on the appetizer menu, but I really need to try the hummus and lebneh. I\'m looking forward to eating a pizza and maybe even tasting a specialty beer next time.

Now this was 6 tacos, nachos and a soda. Hardly an expensive item to make fresh again. Rather than make a fresh order, when I had them redeliver after waiting 90 minutes, they sent out the same order. The food showed up luke warm, the soda was hot and our meals were a mess. 2 of the Tacos were not even in the wrap and the only way to eat it was to scoop it out with a spoon and put it back in to the wrap. Having worked in the food industry for several years, I have never seen a place send out a 2 hour old order. 37 dollars for 2 meals a soda and chips, just make a fresh meal. OK, maybe they are too cheap to do what every other establishment who prides their food would do. At least you can swap out the soda for a cold one.

Feel free to check out the pictures I attached.\n\nUpdate, response to the accusatory owner: I read the follow up by the owner and he is correct, I did miss a few calls, I do accept this as my mistake and I blamed the miscommunication on the floor location on grub hub. The primary reason I was so upset is because of the condition of the food. I made the soda hot? Swapping that out with a cold one would have been free. Is it that hard to heat the food up? I could have just as easily asked for my money back through the app, but trusted in the location to send a quality meal, not perfect, but better than what I received. The owner is also claiming someone, which was either me or the deliver guy (who was a super nice guy by the way) tampered with the food? Now, I was really hungry and just happy to have the food show up. At this time I was ready to dig in to some delicious tacos. But before that, the owner is suggesting I stopped, took a taco out of each one and dumped it out in to the carrier for this review? Come on, I was hungry and this was the straw that broke the camel's back. A simple apology or something polite would have probably swayed me to raise the rating or remove the review, but your accusatory response and your inability to take any accountability in any of this is troubling. For that I will leave the one star rating as it is. Your response is reflective of the meal in which I received, a mess. While I did not blame you for the timeline of the delivery, you were entirely defensive of that only and blamed me. So far as the condition of the food goes, you blame it on someone else, me or some magical creature that tampers with food in tied up bags? You have no accountability for the misses that took place, while placing blame all of it entirely on the customer. I applaud your level of quality that is normally provided and I see you generally have great reviews.

The hollandaise sauce wasn't that flavorful like others I've had. I added hot sauce to give it a kick. The home fries were just ok. Even when I added pepper, and the melted cheese, it was still kind of bland. The Florida Waffle was good, but nothing to wow about. There was plenty of strawberries and bananas, but very few blueberries that were hidden in my whipped cream. I almost thought they forgot to put any in there. The fruit was fresh, but the bananas tasted a bit bitter, probably because they were still green. I tried some of the other's food. The Banana stuffed French toast was good, it was soft and sweet. The Breakfast Salad is more like a fruit parfait. It was honeyed yogurt topped with strawberries, bananas, blueberries & granola. It was a bit overly sweet because of the honey, and bitter because of the bananas. We didn't end up finishing it. \n\nOverall, food portions are rather nice and hearty. I was impressed with our tall juices. Service was great and our server was kind enough to give us all the hot sauces available. I just wasn't impressed with the lack of flavors in my food.

They had the perfectly cooked eggs, crispy bacon, plumped sausages, toast, and large pancakes. I probably won't be back for awhile. I've had better brunch elsewhere with the same price point.

I mean, there are some strong reviews from people I respect, but I didn't think I was about the experience a gastronomic wonder. Chef Mohammed has it going on!  \n\nSomewhat surprising that we were among the very few customers on a Sunday night, but no complaints. The house was recently renovated with a larger dining room, and a touch of class with comfortable seating and sparse, but attractive décor.  Our server, Nema, was excellent.  She knew the questions to ask to make sure we got what we wanted.  Correct level of spiciness, and the right dipping sauces for the dishes ordered. No ice for the water. When undecided about whether to go with garlic or chili naan, she had the ready solution of having the tandoor bake up a combo of the two.  Garlic chili naan, indeed, was a winner. \n\nThe rest was a cavalcade of wonderous dishes that expanded my understanding of what was truly possible in an IndoPak kitchen.  There were only three plates requested; a Samosa Chat app, Chicken Kashmiri and Bhaingan Bharta (eggplant). Each was uniquely distinct from similar plates in other restaurants, and each was outstandingly better.  \n\nThe Chat was a deconstructed Samosa, with the crisp fried dough on the bottom of a mass of tender chickpeas, potatoes and spicy homemade Masala sauce.  It was ordered for medium heat.  Auspicious beginning!  It had a complex flavoring and texture that was similar to other samosas, but somehow better, with a subtle sweet undernote to the usual fritter-like taste.  Delightful. \n\nThe Chicken Kashmiri was ordered because of familiarity with this dish elsewhere; knowing it to be cream based and a lightly sweet alternative to all the curried heat coming from the other sources.  This version was that, but so much more.  Rather than just the combination of the heat from the cream sauce, the sweetness was supplied by raisins, pineapple and dried apricots.  A complete and unexpected surprise, that was in turn a mystery to be solved.  It took a while to figure out what those flavors/textures were.  But, when realization dawned, so did a big smile at the elegantly simple, yet creative genius at work.  Pineapple and apricot discovery was better than a game of charades. I loved this masterstroke. \n\nThe Bhaingan was not as wildly original, but an excellent mashed roast eggplant, green peas, onion, pepper and tomato mixed with traditional herbs and spices.  Ordered hot, it was a nice counterpoint to the cooler sweetness of the Kashmiri. \n\nLast, but far from least, the Garlic Chili Naan, was a knockout bread sensation.  A bit oily, but the interplay of the two main ingredients so well seared to the surface of the naan, and the chewiness and absorption of the lightly crisped dough, made for great taste and the perfect utensil to pick up the sauces from each dish and slowly devour every last drop.   \n\nYes. There was a Mango Lassi, too.  Best way to cool an overheated tongue is to bathe it in cool mangoed yogurt drink.  \n\nZaika - The best meal I have had so far this year."", 'I stopped her around Christmas time with a party of 4.

Of course I had to experiment with the different salsas on the table.

With early 20th Century elevated subway (the El) rumbling above the shadowed street below, it can be difficult to see any hope of renewal. Yet, a closer look shows seeds germinating in the cracks in the sidewalk. \n\nThe 3900 block has several Southeast Asian restaurants that are more than just surviving, but thriving in this unforgiving environment. Vietnamese, Lao, Chinese and Thai kitchens are turning out some of the best cuisine in the city.

A lover of tamarind duck, this was a great counterpoint and subtle reminder of that favorite. The Spring Roll was the weak link, but with the sweet dipping sauce was more of a bridge to what came next. I asked for the Pad Kee Mao to be done ""extra spicy."" That was what I got. Each bite of the veggies, chicken and broad noodles ignited my lips, gums and tongue with a pleasant burn, that gradually increased as I worked my way down the large mound in the wide bowl. Never numbing, I felt as much as tasted every morsel. Special surprise at the bottom of the bowl, where all the oils and spices collected and covered the last few pieces of food. I knew I probably shouldn\'t, but I couldn\'t resist spooning all of that into my mouth. \n\nHoly cow! It was a hot blast that brought tears to my eyes and blew out my sinuses. Tears of joy, I assure you. Should have asked for more napkins, but it all ended well. \n\nThe influence of Lao and Thai cuisine on each other is wonderful.

Chocolate, cherry, pineapple or lemon are their staples. Their cherry is THE best cherry I\'ve ever had and I\'ve been eating water ice my entire life. Their pineapple is my second favorite, tangy lemon is quite good and definitely refreshing! \n\nPrices are inexpensive. For just $1.75 you can get yourself a small 90\'s retro cup filled with two flavors. They are generous with the scoop and a small is really enough. Gelati (1/2 ice, 1/2 ice cream) is also available and is made with hard homemade ice cream here, not custard. If you\'re used to other gelati, maybe try it here since it\'s so different. \n\nThe girls slinging the ice are super efficient and you can tell they\'re ready for a crowd which you will see gather on sweltering days. They\'re so sweet and notably cute. On our last visit when the girl handed me back my change (they are cash only of course) I automatically motioned to put it in the the tip jar except I didn\'t see one. I asked about it and she told me they have to keep it behind the counter because people steal it. Oh, welcome to Philly. So if you so feel inclined to tip, just hand it to the girls and they\'ll safely put it away. \n\nPlease, I beg of you, if you\'re in the city DO NOT go to one of the water-ice chains! It\'s almost sacrilegious, especially while in South Philly. Places like this are the real deal and what you want. John\'s has been a family run business since 1945. It\'s currently run by a 3rd generation owner who uses \u200bonly fresh fruit he personally selects and squeezes by hand, filtered water and sugar.\u200b That\'s it! No preservatives, no additives and no junk like the big names chains use. Trust me, this is where it\'s at. THIS is Italian Philly ""wooder ice"". \n\n*Knocking a star off because I feel they could set up a table or two. Maybe at least a bench. Moms who don\'t want their sticky, wiggly kids in the car feel me..', 'My gf doesn\'t think much of her Johns, but I think a lot of John\'s. It\'s one of those amazing water ice places that can only be found in South Philly. It\'s my 3rd fave of the 4 that I frequent, just ahead of Jimmy\'s, just behind Italiano\'s and Pop\'s. Not sure how to compare Dati\'s to these ones.\n\nWater Ice is like the Roast Pork Sandwich and the infamous Cheesesteak. Only unlike the Cheesesteak (and much like the Pork), it\'s absolutely delicious. I have no idea why, of these 3 claims to food fame, it\'s the bland, boring one (Cheesesteak) that became internationally famous. Forget it. Come here and get yourself a water ice or a Gelati, and you\'ll see what I mean.\n\nWater Ice has been exported around the country now by Rita\'s, which is from Philly, but it\'s still not as famous as it should be. In South Philly you have an assortment of tiny little family-owned water ice shops, which over time will go out of business if we are unlucky. I believe Italiano\'s already has, or will be soon.\n\nGelati mixes layers of frozen custard with water ice. It sounds like it might not work but it absolutely does. It\'s wonderful. Rita\'s does a version using soft serve and it works really well, but since you can get that at Rita\'s, skip that option, and do the Pop\'s original, the unique specialty for South Philly Water Ice shops... the Gelati using hand-dipped hard ice cream. Vanilla, specifically.\n\nThere are some ridiculously attractive servers here at this location, especially the owner (I think) who is the really extremely tanned one (swoon). The boys are really hot here too, so my girl says. She flirted a little too much with them and I liked that she did that a little too much.\n\nAs for the products. Nice lemon, has a good taste. Not too crazy about the cherry but it wasn\'t bad. I love the texture of John\'s, it has an excellent mush consistency. The birthday cake flavour ice cream is just awful. It\'ll set you back around 1 75. \n\nI was going to say this is the most ""Jersey Shore"" of the Philly water ice stores, and then I found out that *omg* they have one in Jersey too. Figures.', ""Summer has only just begun, but I've already made several trips to John's for their delicious water ice. My favorite is a pineapple and cherry combo. Both flavors are perfection and just the right amount of sweet. The prices are great; it's two bucks for a small which is perfect for an every day sort of treat. I look forward to many visits as the weather heats up!""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333,1.0,15.0

Now, you might think that before such a concert, we should have a bottle of red, or ooooooooo, a bottle of white, but that wasn't the kind of mood we were in that night. No, on another night, You May be Right, but not tonight.

However, it came with quinoa (or rice, but I went healthy) and blackened chicken and it was very good.  Don't recall what Melissa got, but I am fairly certain she enjoyed it too.\n\nThis is a great place for a pre-show meal for a couple of reasons.  First, it is within walking distance.  Second, because it is off the beaten path a bit, it was not nearly as busy as the places in Channelside or Fergs Live, or even some of the other pubs and restaurants in the business area of downtown Tampa.  We were surprised how easy it was to get a table.\n\nThat said, a number of reviews complained about the service, and while our server was friendly and everything was fine, service was slow.  Normally, I would consider deducting a star for it, but it wasn't so bad that it screwed up our evening.

You can have unlimited mimosas for $20.00, which I did not partake in.  However, my friend did and her mimosa was more of a glass of champagne with a splash of OJ.  The cost of the unlimited mimosas was a bit more than I\'m used to, being an Orlandoan (usually $10.00 to $15.00 at most).  I opted for one of their local craft beers that was on tap.  They had a good selection to choose from, which is always a plus in my book.\n\nThe brunch menu was a little lacking to me.  Nothing stood out and made me say ""oohhh, that sounds awesome!""  Same goes for the lunch menu.  However, I did enjoy my meal and thought it was very tasty.  I ended up ordering a flatbread off of the lunch menu that had alfredo, bacon, and spinach on it.  I also added grilled chicken to it, which I thought made the flatbread much better and more filling. \n\nWe sat at the bar and I thought the service was great.  Our bartender was attentive, offered suggestions when we asked for them, and always made sure our drinks were full.  My only suggestion would be for the bartenders to be more up-to-date on the beers offered on tap.

I knew from the pictures on Yelp that I definitely wanted to try the crab cake. Believe me when I tell you it's all crab, and no cake! It's a wonderful mass of crab meat and its warm when served. It's perfect, and I'd highly recommend you order it.  As for the main meal I ordered a filet which was cooked perfectly, and had a good flavor. I also ordered the creamed spinach. This was also good, but I think it might have needed a little salt and pepper to make it even better. Then there was the lobster au gratin. This dish was awesome, and with the steak it was perfect.  I was not kidding when I said I was treating myself.\nOverall I had a great experience at Galatoire's 33 Bar & Steak. I'd most definitely return, and would encourage others to give it a try if you haven't already."", ""I really wanted to love Galatoire's 33 but our lunch experience wasn't up to par with similar establishments. Ambiance was reminiscent of old world New Orleans with Southern elegance. Food and service were average.\n\nA warm complimentary loaf of bread and soft, rich butter were happily devoured as we waited for our drinks and food. The crab cake appetizer was ultimate goodness- filled with tons of crab meat and very lightly breaded on the outside. I welcome more meat over breading! The crab cake was fresh and not overly salty. This one almost rivals the one at Vic & Anthony's! The Caesar salad was one of the best I've had in a long time because it had the right amount of dressing, topped with an anchovy.\n\nThe 16 oz ribeye came with edges burnt to a crisp. I had to cut off the edges because they were literally black and inedible! However, that did not stop me from devouring the rest of the medium-cooked steak, which was nicely seasoned. The brown butter mushrooms were deliciously buttery and juicy. The steamed asparagus were overcooked (I don't like mushy asparagus!). \n\nService was impeccable but more on the slow side. We didn't mind waiting but would have appreciated more promptness after dining to get the check and to-go boxes. I would recommend Galatoire's 33 just for cocktails and appetizers at their lovely bar. With the higher prices and established reputation, I expected more of the wow factor. Overall, I wasn't blown away with a stellar experience and might have to rethink coming back in the future."", ""So I have to start this review by telling you about Tacy, the bartender.... Not just a bartender, but THE BARTENDER (You must use all caps). She is very knowledgeable, friendly, and talented and has a great smile. She really makes you feel comfortable and want to stay awhile with her great attitude. She is great a creating drinks that she may think you like based on your taste buds, which is never wrong.  She makes great classics to different creations, espec ially get her to make you up one of her tasty shots when you getting your night started.  My favorite cocktails at this location consist of whiskey (they have a great selection) and a simple Champagne and St Germain.   What also makes this place great as the bartender; you never know what shall happen. Once visiting, Tacy THE BARTENDER, she sung some Etta James with a piano player. She can sing her heart out! She makes me smile and just want to have a nice classy sip!\n\n I have tried a few of their appetizers, my favorite include their deviled egg (so divine), Jumbo Lump Crab Cake, and the baked oysters. I honestly have nothing bad to say about any of these appetizers. They were all tasty and just right.\n\nAtmosphere is pretty upscale yet relaxed at the same time. In the bar area seems like a nice place to even enjoy some sports watching. The only downfall is the location is directly on Bourbon, but you can find street/lot parking close by so you wouldn't have to walk around the area much unless it's something you are into.""]",0.5,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,1.0,50.0

Ruby must have the hands of an angel, because I felt no pain. Nothing. She was very thorough and took more time on me and my eyebrows than my other lady ever had!

Mine was the smoothest and most elegant Old-Fashioned I\'ve ever tasted. Jesse is a boss.\n\nMy buddy and I had arrived with a plan in mind. The flexibility of Suraya\'s tasting menu and the range of choices it offered appealed to us, and we\'d already made our selections.\n\nBut then we were shown to our table, a perch set slightly above the main floor that provided a view of the open kitchen, where a wood-burning oven was cooking the dinner I didn\'t know I wanted.\n\nAs she took our order, our server, Nena, asked if I\'d like the special: slow-roasted young goat with stewed chick peas, Swiss chard, garlic and cilantro, finished with crispy shallots, lemon yogurt and goat jus.\n\nAre you kidding me?\n\nDoes a stranded man long for his lover\'s embrace? Do birds enjoy a light thermal lift as they cross the sea? And, speaking of birds, do Eagles fans revel as Tom Brady slips into aged decrepitude?\n\nThe answers, of course, are ""yes,"" ""yes,""  and ""Hell, yes!"" \n\nI thanked Nena and asked, ""May I please have the goat as a part of the tasting menu?"" She said, ""Sure,"" then left for the kitchen.\n\nSoon, Nena brought our mezza, then these things happened:\n\n- Substantial but light and slightly lemony hummus that reminded me of the hummus my Teta made by hand, fifty years ago\n\n- Baba ganoush, whose charred eggplant was seasoned with tehina, lemon, garlic and a special treat: sweet and smokey urfa biber chili\n\n- Muhammara, a smooth spread of roasted red pepper and pulverized walnuts blended with chili and cumin \'til it was dense and rich, like pesto, but spicier and more appetizing \n\n- Labneh, an Arab dairy respite from smoke and spice, a purpose served in other cuisines by lassi, tzatziki and kefir\n \n- Tabouli, a usual hearty and cooling salad of parsley, cucumber, tomato, scallion and mint, made unusual by a tart drop of pomegranate molasses\n\nNena, a skilled and personable server, was unstoppable, as was the mezza, which also included: fried kibbeh (beef and bulgur ""dumplings"" stuffed with raisins & pine nuts); fattoush (another salad, dressed with lemon-pomegranate vinaigrette); and baskets of fresh-baked Arab bread or ""khubz"" that was just-chewy, tender and good enough to eat on its own, all night long.\n\n**********\nHere\'s how to eat at Suraya: bite, savor, look around, order more, take a different bite, chat, sip, then do it all again.\n\nDining at a Lebanese table is a creative endeavor that requires one to engage; ""What should I taste next? How would this taste if combined with that?"" We\'re also asked to appreciate the art on the plate; not gratuitous ""look-what-I-can-do"" decoration, but actual food, placed in such a way that the eater is enticed not to gush and take photos, but to eat.\n\nBy now, seven stellar dishes into the evening, I\'d abandoned my usual pessimistic expectations. I was persuaded to trust Suraya\'s chef and his cooks to respectfully interpret recipes handed down by the owners\' grandmother - the eponymous Suraya - and developed in consultation with her daughter, Maude.\n\nIt was clear that they weren\'t trying to improve (or, despicably, to ""reimagine"") Suraya\'s food in some Millennial way, but were instead doing as they\'d been taught, then ever-so-slightly tweaking, using best-quality and authentic ingredients that took their food from what one might find at home to dishes one might find in the best hotels along Beirut\'s Corniche.\n\n**********\nFor his main course, or ""mashawi"" - a rough equivalent to the Italian ""secondo"" - my friend ordered kawarma - Suraya\'s grilled and slow-roasted lamb, which was rubbed with ""baharat,"" a mixture of black pepper, allspice, cardamom and other savory spices.\n\nI tasted his meal, which was delectable. Then I savored my own fork-tender, succulent, almost buttery portion of goat ribs and loin. I\'m embarrassed to say that I gloated as I announced that my plate won the evening.\n\nFinally, as a bonus, Suraya only offers roasted goat every few weeks - ten orders per night - and by coming across it when I did, I lucked out. \n\nSo really; thanks again, Zahav.', ""The one thing I will say about Suraya is the layout is absolutely beautiful and well thought out. The front is more like a chill cafe for casuals which blends into the main dining area for both casuals and some fine dining without seeming like their trying to hard. \nThe decor of Suraya reminds me of the one friend with the one Aunt /Uncle with old money that no one in the family actually knows what they do for a living, but damn can they throw a chill gathering with good food and good vibes. \nThe food itself is pretty solid and more portions than I expected. \nThe only thing I did expect was a lot more flavor, but it just wasn't all the way there. Not that the food wasn't amazing, but I didn't day dream about it as much as I daydreamed about the decor.\nWe ordered the mushroom hummus which was the best item of the bunch. Full of flavor and nice big portion of it. The falafel wrap was what you would expect. A wrap. \nI will surely be back to Suraya to try the cafe side next time out of pure curiosity, especially since they have a kid menu."", ""Obsessed!! Not only with the insanely gorgeous space that showcases impeccable attention to detail and so many stunning ways to honor and highlight the culture... in the decor, market goods and dish-ware, but with the food too. And I haven't even tried half of the traditional Lebanese offerings! \n\n I'm going to go bold here and say Suraya dishes up the best falafel I've ever had...and I've eaten falafel in the Middle East! It's pretty darn fantastic!! Unbelievable, actually. Crispy fried golden exterior, perfect warm interior. Perfect crunch to soft ratio. So incredibly delish! If you want to save the carbs or just eat a smidge lighter, go for the balls themselves, and not the platter. Not listed, just ask! \n\nTo date, I've tried two of their hummus flavors... the mushroom and the crispy chickpea. They're both uber creamy, totally flavorful, loaded with toppings, and just excellent. Up there as my second favorite hummus in ALL of Philly! \n\nI've also tried their baba ganoush complete with pomegranate seeds! What a lovely, crunchy, colorful addition to the dish. This smoked eggplant dip has just the right amount of smokiness and garlic! Great texture too! \n\nTheir rosewater lemonade is just beautiful and refreshing. I absolutely love it! Tart and sweet. A must! \n\nThe clementine ginger beer with cardamom served in a copper mule mug is also fantastic! \n\nThe beet salad, and Man'oushe (Lebanse flatbread) are up for me next! Oh, and the tehina hot chocolate! Yessss!! \n\nMake sure to leave some time to walk around the entire space. It's just gorgeous! The cafe is super sweet with fresh deep jewel tone blooms on each table and bright light shining through the big windows. The bar is gorgeous and inviting. The dining room is spacious and candle-lit, and the back porch will transport you to another country!! I can't wait until it's officially open back there! I'm in love with the patterned pillows, wrap around bench, wood-burning fireplace and tiled floor!! Oh, and definitely take a peek at the goods for sale. Most of them, if not all, are straight from Lebanon. Spices, oils, body goods, and textiles too! It's like perusing a shuk! \n\nThe only things that bum me out are the fact that they're closed on Mondays. There have been several, several Mondays I've wanted to go. Also, the fact that they don't take ressies for brunch. I really wanted to bring my mom and our fam here for Mother's Day. Perhaps a dinner soon will be better? Those cocktails and even the Lebanese beer are calling my name. I hear Open Table is starting to accept reservations for that time frame!\n\nI cannot say enough good things about Suraya!! It's such a pleasure for all the senses to dine here. I'm so in love! I heard 'Suraya' is the name of the owner's grandmother. They are certainly making her proud. \n\nI honestly can't see me ever tiring of this gem! It's really worthy of all of the hype it's receiving!\n\n*There's street parking which is easy to find during the day, but also an entire lot across the street!""]",0.25,0.0,0.0,0.625,0.125,1.0,50.0

We sat down in the window to the left, and were IMMEDIATELY served complimentary chips and two kinds of salsa, red and verde. We ordered their guacamole to give us time to look at the menu. I apologized to our waitress at least 3 times because she kept coming back and I still wasn\'t sure, so know that the staff is very attentive. \n\nThe place has an authentic look about it, in terms of a Mexican restaurant where actual Mexicans and/or Central Americans living or visiting New Orleans would eat, if that makes sense. The menu has the names of the dishes in Spanish with half the explanations in English and half in Spanish and some explanations in both... It was only us and two other tables; one with a very unhappy baby, but it was nice to not be on top of other people eating dinner.  \n\nThe guacamole arrived, and we ordered the large Cocktail de Camarones and the pork Tostadas Mexicanas to split. Their guacamole is more of a soupier guacamole, not really chunky at all, but so so good. You can pick up flavors of cilantro and lime, and I really like this spin on a guacamole that\'s almost more of a guacamole salsa. \n\nThe Cocktail de Camarones and Tostadas arrived not long after. They were both picture perfect as you can see; the tostadas matching their picture on the menu to a T. I should\'ve seen that their were refried beans on the tostadas, aka frijoles, but I guess I thought I could pick around them. If you like beans, you\'ll like these since they make up the majority of the Tostadas with not a copious amount of pork on them. I didn\'t think the flavor was really there (again, I\'m not a huge bean person, so take note). The Cocktail de Camarones reminded me more so of an Ecuadorian shrimp ceviche rather than your typical shrimp cocktail, and it\'s the closest I\'ve come to tasting that flavor here in New Orleans. In Ecuador they use ketchup in their ceviche to tone down the acidity of the lime. The best way to describe it was, ""tangy."" Again if I hadn\'t been sharing, I probably would\'ve added some heat, but it was a goblet of shrimp, and a ton of avocado, so I would definitely order this dish again. \n\nThe split bill was equivalent to us both getting a footlong Subway, and we had an app and two dishes, so I\'ll probably stop in here again to try some other things, right after I knock out a few chapters of my Rosetta Stone.', 'In this modest vehicular path adjacent Earthling structure devoted to inserting various manifestations of flattened grain plants into one\'s digestive tract, you will find a heightened pleasure to your molecular sample receptors previously unknown to the typical long-term neural storage networks clustered within an average American bipedal primate\'s hardened calcium-enclosed neck weight.\n\n* Would you like the ion channels in your own muscular hydrostat to absorb the altogether similar ions in the sliced up muscular hydrostat of a previously homeostatically metabolizing bovine pasture mammal, within the confines of what is called a ""chimichanga""?\n\n* Would you like to experience the unborn embryos of a grain-fattened generally flightless bird in a ""ranch"" sauce, aside repeatedly lipid-heated legumes and gaseous-water thermodynamically-accelerated paddy-cultivated cereal grains with even some coagulated infant-feeding protein fluid to complete the meal?\n\n* Would you like to rehydrate with a disaccharide-enhanced carbohydrate solution derived from the rectangular cell-walled pulp of numerous species of ripened flowering non-human ovaries?\n\nThe answer to all of these is the creation of the sound: ""Sí"".

But if you want authentic, delicious, and cheap Mexican food in NOLA, TG is your place. \n\nBut you don\'t need Spanish, do you? Because I just posted their menu for you, and it has pictures on it.  I mean, did you come for the conversation or for the food? The menu even has numbers on it, so just tell\'m ""numero tres,"" or point. Then have a seat, sit down, eat, and smile. \n\nI can vouch for the awesomeness of their chiles rellenos, pupusas and tacos pastores, so far, but I plan to continue working my way through the menu. Can\'t beat the central, Mid-city location on Carrollton, can you? And I think that the comments here by other yelpers about the decor are a little unfair. It isn\'t fancy by any standard, but it is very clean and nicer than I expected after reading other reviews here. \n\nThe only bummer is that they don\'t serve alcohol, but that means you can bring your own. Hard to bring a Margarita though, like the one you can get at ""Juan\'s Flying Burrito"" down the street, but in my opinion, the food here is much better and cheaper, so nine times out of ten, I go here and BMOB, or get take out and make the margaritas at home. \n\nBesides, the juices and horchata here are as tasty as they are refreshing, so who needs alcohol? They have really killer seafood and savory soups as well, which will improve your mood on rainy days. This review is starting to sound like an advertisement, but after not trying this place due to its outward appearance for some time, it was the food that made me a believer, and I think you\'ll agree. A book by its cover, right? \n\nAnyway, it\'s the kind of place I am likely to return to often for the flavor and for the deal, a much appreciated piece of Mexico right here in Mid-city. \n\nVivan los guerreros!']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

It's actually a park with a walking path that hugs the river for 1.4 miles with many points of entry.

I went there because my dog has been coping with a chronic gastrointestinal problem and as it is advertised as integrative medicine, I thought they would offer holistic alternatives. I scheduled a consultation with Dr. Randy Aaronson because I was hoping to help my dog and avoid the expensive endoscopy which I told him at our visit.  He was very encouraging that there were several things and an endoscopy was much further down the line.  Unfortunately, the blood test, x-rays, and fecal test were negative.  When the medication he gave my dog did not resolve the problem within two weeks, Dr. Aaronson suggested doing the endoscopy (close to $3000) rather than spending a lot of money on trying other things. He's correct that this procedure is the ideal way to guide the treatment of GI problems.  It is worth noting that even with a diagnosis, not all dogs will respond to treatment or they will relapse.  \n\nI was surprised that Dr. Aaronson could only offer prescription dog food and worming as alternatives to the endoscopy. Recommending the endoscopy was, he said, to avoid spending a lot of money trying different things.  I'm confused-- what are some of these things that would cost a lot of money?\n\nMy other concern with PAWS is that at the time of my initial visit when we didn't know for sure what the tests she was given that day would reveal and her GI tract was upset, I was sold over a month's supply of Tylan.  Then after two weeks when it hadn't resolved the problem, he recommended the endoscopy.  I wondered why so many pills in the first place (at $140) when we didn't know they would work.  I also was sold that day three supplements that I could only begin using after she got better. Looking back I wish I had had the presence of mind to question this since as it turns out I'm still not sure when I can give them to my dog. \n\nIf you can afford to spend over a $1000 in diagnosing your pet's GI disease, I'd recommend PAWS.  My impression of Dr. Aaronson is that he is knowledgeable, upbeat, and experienced and the staff is caring and professional.  Unfortunately, I ended up feeling like since I couldn't spend the money they were done with me.  I got the impression that I was too much trouble since I wasn't going to accrue credit card debt.

You might miss it if you\'re not looking, and you might miss the turn if you\'re passing by it on the west-bound side of the road.\n\nThe question today is, should you make sure to make that turn?\n\nHere\'s the thing. Do you enjoy eating in spaces with a chrome-polished medical center cleanliness? If you answered yes, then Westside is ideal for you. Contrary to last week\'s Flying Pie, you won\'t find any cutesy plastered papers on the walls or hilarious soda fountain puns. Instead, you\'ll be greeted with a clean, shiny, orderly grouping of tables and chairs and the convenient drone of whatever sports game is likely to bring people in that week.\n\nPerhaps they haven\'t found the thing that ""makes them cool"" yet, but you could probably walk out of Westside and into any brand new sports bar and not know any different. The atmosphere was effectively nonexistent.\n\nThe staff were friendly in the sense that they seemed thankful they didn\'t work in a Little Caesar\'s. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to praise.\n\nBut of course, sometimes the quality of the pizza can be so good, it makes you forget about all your little disappointments in life. So, how was it?\n\nWell we ordered up a ""Grand"" sized pizza, half of it pepperoni and the other half was a specialty called ""Veggie Gourmet,"" which boasted artichoke hearts, pesto base, and sun-dried tomatoes. The size chart in Westside claims ""Grand, Large, Medium, and Small,"" but what we got out of a Grand felt like the same as what you\'d get at Little Caesar\'s. No inches to help you confirm, either, but lemme tell you, the ""Grand"" is not so big as it might sound.\n\nThe price, for the pizza and one drink (everyone else in our party got water), came out to around $30.\n\n-Pepperoni-\nWestside could probably boast their Pepperoni as their signature. To be honest, the visit was not my first in my tasting of their pizza. But in all my experiences with their pizza, no specialty has yet beat their pepperoni. But this isn\'t necessarily a compliment. It\'s good, nothing great. The sauce has a solid mixture of spices, the peps are toasted well (but not quite crunchy, unfortunately), and the cheese plays its part right. You eat it and go, ""This is pizza, yep."" And then you remember the price tag and you start to wonder if you shouldn\'t have just hit up the ol\' LC.\n\n-Veggie Gourmet-\nThe artichoke hearts were cut very large, which I like. The tomatoes, however, seemed almost absent. I\'m pretty sure they were on there, but they were hidden under the layer of cheese. I know I tasted them at times, but it was hard to identify any thoughts towards the tomatoes because my buds were being severely overwhelmed by the thick pouring of pesto. Pesto base is generally a favorite of mine, but I have to say that it felt like a little much here.

Hopefully your dad is footing the bill, too. Stick to the pepperoni and you\'ll be fine.\n\n3 slices out of 5', ""My review is going to be tough but when it comes to pizza I know my stuff. I've had pizzas in every single state, 42 countries, and locally, I believe this is at least the 20th pizza spot I've tried. \n\nPizza in Boise, ID isn't life changing anywhere but when there's amazing spots like the Wildler and Red Bench Pizza, there's no excuse for choosing a place like this. \n\nWe've tried supporting them multiple times, but after continuously poor experiences I need to share my 2 star review. First: the ingredients. Everything tastes cheap. Honestly it tastes like enriched white flour with generic store bought cheap ingredients. If you're used to picking the cheapest flour, cheese and marinara sauce from Walmart this might taste similar, but if you have a palate that's used to high-quality ingredients, this just tastes cheap. \n\nThe pizza crust is always extremely dry, flavorless, and there's no oil or crunch at the bottom. It's just bland. There's nothing worse than unmemorable calories but that's exactly what this is. \n\nNext: customer service. We've ordered pre-covid-19 and during. Pre-covid we were never greeted, never thanked for grabbing our order and if we asked for anything like extra marinara it was never given. Now that we're in the middle of it, we've waited in our car when they said they'd bring it out, but instead it was left in under artificial heat until we walked inside. Fool me once ok. But say it twice and I'm actually upset, especially if I'm waiting in my car a half hour longer than I need to and I have a type one diabetic sitting next to me who needs food when it's ready.\n\nI really want to support all local establishments, this one included, but until they attempt to offer a superior product to the competition, they don't deserve to be anyone's first, second or even third choice.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0

I went with the burger, cooked medium. It came out prepared as requested and the beef was super juicy, but I thought it was lacking in seasoning. It was an okay burger but I'd probably try something else next time. \n\nService was great -\xa0attentive and friendly.

With its cozy atmosphere, cool background music, and great friendly service, I\'ve already become a regular in just the first couple weeks this bar has been open. From the food to the cocktails, Lloyd knows what they\'re doing and they are doing it right! This bar is just what the neighborhood needed and it will be a hotspot for locals and visitors alike for a long time!\n\nHere\'s what I\'ve tried so far:\n\nThe Food:\nTexas Tommy- This delicious and decadent hot dog is served smothered in cheese sauce, wrapped in bacon, and topped off with bourbon soaked bacon. Maybe the best hot dog I\'ve ever had. I could eat these things all night!\n\nLloyd Burger- I order my burgers medium rare and this one came out perfectly. As the menu states, they use a special house blend of beef, muenster cheese, pickled onion, lettuce, tomato, on a brioche bun. Delicious! It also comes with awesome fries.\n\nGoldfish-Crusted Mac & Cheese- Creamy cheesy goodness. Can\'t go wrong with this dish!\n\nGreen Tomato Grilled Cheese- Provolone, gruyere, and muenster cheese on sourdough. Grilled just right and served with a field green salad.\n\nCrispy Fried Deviled Eggs- The caper aioli is the perfect accompaniment for this tasty appetizer.\n\nDesserts: I\'ve tried both the rice pudding and the bread pudding. Each are a perfect way to end you meal (unless you\'d prefer another whiskey!).\n\nThe Cocktails:\nI can honestly say Lloyd served up the best Manhattan and Old Fashioned I\'ve ever had! The happy hour is from 5-7pm and some of their cocktails and beers are on special. I recommend the Jack & Wendy and The Overlook (simply because I\'m a huge fan of The Shining). I hope one day I\'ll find a ""Delbert Grady"" on the cocktail menu.  Looking for something quick and easy? Go with ""The Lloyd"", only $5 for a can of Miller High Life and a shot of Old Grand Dad.\n\nWith dozens of bourbons, ryes, Irish Whiskey, and Scotch Whisky on the menu, you can\'t go wrong. Whiskey isn\'t your thing? No problem! Lloyd has plenty of beers, wines and other spirits to loosen up your inhibitions. \n\nAs you can tell, I\'ve been sampling a lot of the menu and haven\'t been disappointed yet. I\'m looking forward to trying the chicken po\' boy, the beef stew, and BBQ turkey meatloaf in the near future. \n\n""I like ya Lloyd, I\'ve always liked ya. The best damn bar from Timbuktu to Portland, Maine...or Portland, Oregon for that matter."" -Jack Torrence, The Shining', ""Lloyd is quickly becoming one of my favorite places to hang out in Fishtown. I have had a few of their appetizers and have also been one night for a whiskey and pork pairing event featuring Brooklyn Brewery, but mainly I come to drink and enjoy the atmosphere. Their customer service is top-notch. Whenever I walk in, no matter how busy the place is, someone seemingly appears from nowhere to seat me, whether at a table or at the bar. Once seated, I never have to wait long for another drink or even a refill on my water.\n\nI'm more of a beer drinker myself and would love it if they had a more expansive draft list to choose from, but I always find something I like in what they do have. My partner is a whiskey drinker so he's never lacking in choices here. They also know their stuff when it comes to cocktails and you can tell they take pains to make sure a drink is made correctly.\n\nWe usually show up on the later side of things and Lloyd can get somewhat crowded on weekend nights, but I've always been comfortable no matter the size of the crowd. The atmosphere is what puts Lloyd over the top for me; I love the music and the classy, understated decor. Some of the other whiskey bars in the city can be a little over the top for my taste. Lloyd gets it right in my opinion.""]",0.8571428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.0,1.0,30.0

We put money into the jukebox, waited our turn, and the shit heel bartender publicly insulted us.\n\nAt this point I demanded the bartender refund the money from the jukebox and close my tab. He refunded me $1 out of the $4 I put into the machine. He returned my debit card with no receipt and told me to leave. The next day I found that he had charged my card $125.

He is a physician and that was his area of specialty when he practiced medicine in Afghanistan before coming to the United States with his wife and children a few years ago.  My understanding is the family's relocation was with assistance of an American General after Shams helped with military patients at Bagram AFB.\n\nIt is lucky for us that while Dari is not a language my husband and I speak at all, English is a language Shams speaks well enough for us to be grateful to him for the hospitality he extends to his customers at Kabab House, which he purchased in mid 2018 I think.  (Reviews and photos prior to that will be for the previous owner's time.)\n\nAnd before I share more about our dining experiences, I feel compelled to speak about a recent reviewer who was so critical of language obstacles as to leave a 1 star for that reason when she was twice advised by her host of the 20 minute time it took to grill kabobs she ordered for take out.  Acknowledging language challenges exist and with respect for her right to hold an opinion, I wonder if she would have been so ungracious in review had she known the backstory. \n\nFrom our experience, thanks to Shams' effort to speak English and our wanting to listen to and speak with this charming man, we have enjoyed the food served in his restaurant and the hospitality of customers treated like family.  For this physician in Afghanistan turned restaurant owner in the US and for this family business and for the food we say five stars in the context of the whole.\n\nA TRUE FAMILY BUSINESS:  My husband and I are 'food explorers' (or in my case even food obsessed) and familiar with some cuisines of the Middle East like Lebanese, Israeli, Persian (Iranian) and Iraqi dishes.  We are also familiar with the food of Pakistan which, like Iran, borders Afghanistan in Central Asia.  But Kabob House has provided our introduction to Afghanistan food.  All of the food here is cooked by Sham's wife and served to tables by him.  In true family business style, his sons assist in the kitchen and with table service when they are out of school.  Open seven days a week for lunch and dinner, imagine the hard work to make that happen.\n\nSPARKLING AND WELCOMING:  Remembering that Shams' original profession was physician, it likely explains how sparkling clean is the restaurant.  And it is welcoming for all people for seating at a combination of standard height tables and chairs, some traditional low upholstered seating booths, and a couple of standard height booths as well.  There is no music sound system and we love that for being able to enjoy conversation with other diners and with Shams.\n\nWEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET & MAIN MENU & FOOD:  The previous owners of Kabob House had a lunch buffet and a couple of months ago Shams started offering one too.  We enjoyed trying it once to acquaint us with something we had not seen on the main menu -  a wonderful Afghanistan styled baked bean dish that I'll be sure to look for on the menu now - and delicious chicken tikka masala since chicken is not a protein we typically order. \n\nBut our favorite way to eat here is to order from the menu which ranges from appetizers through salad and soup to kabobs and sides like basmati rice and naan and main dishes and desserts.  Family platters are offered too.\n\nKabob dishes may be the draw, given the restaurant name, but it is worth noting quobali polow (spelling?) which is recognized as a national dish of Afghanistan.  There may be as many variations of this dish as there are cooks in Afghanistan, but in general it is lamb under a bed of basmati rice topped with carrots and raisins.  At Kabob House the lamb is a large roasted shank and this is a dish that can easily feed two. (All animal proteins used at Kabob House are Halal.)\n\nMost cuisines have a  'savory turnover' in the repertoire (like samosas in Indian food or empanadas in Latin America) and the sambosas on this menu of savory pastry filled with potatoes and split peas are delicous.  They came with a cilantro sauce alongside to use if you want to which is so good that my husband and I were tempted to drink it!\n\nNaan is excellent and it comes with the cilantro sauce alongside.\n\nThe Persian tea served here is lovely in fragrance and flavor, made with whole green tea leaves and cardamom.\n\nOne lunch time visit when we shared our sambosas with the couple at the next table, they ordered dessert for us of tiny little tender fried dumplings served in a small pool of perfect-barely sweet brothy syrup.  Delightful.  The rice pudding here, it has mango in it I think, is really good too.  \n\nACCESSIBILITY:  ADA parking in private mall lot.  Level in the door and all on one floor inside.  Ample floor space.  Standard height seating."", ""Kabob House \n\nExotic yet familiar food in a hospitable and inviting atmosphere. \n\nName dropping  \nAfter reading yelp legend Michele's review, Indy and I decided to have dinner here.

We  ordered sabzi chalow (basmati rice and sautéed spinach), naan (flat bread), sambosas (delightful turnovers filled with potatoes and split peas) and green Persian chai.

Scolds the schoolmaster in Pink Floyd\'s The Wall. English boarding school cooks must not have been influenced by Afghan cuisine, post British occupation. Because you will have no problem eating your meat that Kabob House lays out before you on wide rectangular plates. The lamb, beef combo comes with a few veggies and a green chutney type dipping sauce that must have cilantro. Lamb is the perfect red meat because sheep are raised in smaller operations than other animals. These lamb kabobs honor the special status of this sacred animal. The spices and grilling deliver a spectacular flavor. No wonder we sacrifice lambs to the gods. The beef is good too but,... Did I mention the lamb? Thanks, Allah for providing!\n\nThe side salad is large and lightly dressed. Every leaf was verdant, showing attention to freshness seldom seen even from the nearby Saladman (who should change his name to BagofPreservedSaladMan, by the way.)\n\nGreen Persian Tea has cardamom spice which blends nicely with the other fare. Order a second pot for your final course. I\'m speaking of the pudding, of course. \n\nRoger Waters probably would not have been such a sourpuss if he had some Shir Brenge (Brenj?) for dessert. The name literally means rice milk, but it is really Persian rice pudding. No wonder the Iranian Guardians of the Revolution are so zealous. This rice pudding is worthy of fanatic fundamentalism. \n\nKabob House reminds me that South Central Asian food is top of the world. Thanks for opening in Boise to  jog my memory of travels long ago. \n\nSpend an afternoon here (buffet ends at 2:30) and chillax with the afternoon crowd, drink a third pot of tea, and write something about Anglo-Afghan encounters.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

I didn't want fries so why couldn't I have fried yucca instead? I did order some on the side which raised my bill another 4 bucks. Thumbs down for that. Another thing I would not have chosen is rice , but they don't offer other options with the combo meals like my favorite place Pico Rojo. If you want the good sides, you have to order them separate. Blah. \nI should have never cheated on my Pico Rojo. Oh, I loved my Passion Fruit juice, almost forgot about that. Wrapping it up, I would try this place again if I was in the area and a friend wanted to eat here, but I will not come out of my way because I wasn't very impressed. My lunch was too expensive for sides i didn't want"", 'We like to try new eateries.  Last night, I was trying to think of someplace unique to grub down at, and I saw the review for Cuenelli\'s. We have driven past this spot 5 or 6 times, but never when we  are actually hungry, so I made sure we were hungry tonight. \n\nWe can throw my knowledge of authentic Peruvian recipes out the window. Other than knowing that the potato originated in the geographical region of Inca Empire, I don\'t know Jack crap about the food, and have never had it. That being said, what I can tell you is that the food was magical. We throw down at a lot of Latin spots, but this was completely different. The flavors were not what you\'d get from a Caribbean Latin restaurant at all, and that was a pleasant change.\n\nI had the LOMO SALTADO, which I believe roughly translates to ""this dish will make you wanna slap ur momma."" (I\'ve added a pic for visual assistance.) This was a sirloin or flank-type steak cut into thin strips and stir fried in a soy-vinegar sauce with tomatoes and onions. It was served on a bed of french fries and with what seemed like an endless supply of white rice. (I thought only Puerto Ricans served dishes on top of fries.)\n\nLa Chica had the BISTEC A LO POBRE, which roughly translates to ""poor people\'s steak."" This was a palomilla steak served with fries, white rice, black beans, amarillos and topped with a fried egg. This dish is actually pretty common in Latin America. Hell, you can get the American version at IHOP. The whole world probably eats some variation of this dish. Either way, it was really good.\n\nWe did order some chicken since that\'s their staple item, and it was really good. It came with CILANTRO RICE (a-freaking-mazing) and SPICY BEANS. The chicken was moist, tender and cooked to perfection. It came with 2 dipping sauces that accented the flavor of the chicken beautifully.\n\nWe will definitely go back.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0

There is a very good variety, & it's a relatively large store.  The are four MD markets in the Tampa Bay area.\n\nIf it's saute pans, flying pans; pots, woks, steamers; kitchen tools; bowls; cups; chopsticks; an insulated thermos; coffee cups & pots; tea pots & accessories; & rice cookers (etc.) you seek, the aisles are long & well-stocked-- just an extensive variety @ decent prices. SEE PIC.\n\nIn the far back of this market is a seafood counter w/ tanks. Some of the tanks could use a good cleaning, but the fishes; lobster; crab; eel; frogs; & other interesting live sea creatures appeared healthy. Two somber-looking staffers were working behind the counter-- see pic. \n\nThere is one long refrigerated case of packaged meat along the back wall; & at least two displays of fresh produce. The produce was BEAUTIFUL-- ALL very fresh. The meat was very good in color & texture. I had fun checking out the pork kidney, pork spleen, & pork liver, as well as the duck tongue. There are also refrigerator cases of packaged fish & other such water creatures. \n\nVertical & horizontal floor freezer cases hold MANY food items: a variety of eggs; Tofu; buns; dumplings; spring rolls; desserts; ice-creams; appetizers; veggies; meats; & a gazillion more food items that I found fascinating. (This is a market that makes browsing fun.) There were also many refrigerator cases; I was especially surprised to find many varieties of hotdogs-- SEE PIC. \n\nWithin the walls of this store is an elongated aisle of rice & one of noodles (and a refrigerator case of them to the far left as you enter). There's also an aisle of teas-- SO many teas. Many other food items sat in plastic bags & cartons on selves, including kelp & dried fungi. Almost all the aisles were well-stocked except one. \n\nThe store was not spotless, but it was satisfactory. All food products were price-marked-- shelves were labeled & prices were visible. Not one of the items I handled had an expiration date that had passed. \n\nI had difficulty locating a staff member to assist me in my trek for frozen Bao Buns (Korean). Once I finally located an older gentleman, he didn't seem to understand me. In fact, he kept pointing to the non-frozen rack of dessert rolls. I was on my own.\n\nEmployees spoke Chinese; however, the manager spoke English at the register while discussing payment. I love hearing foreign languages (and expect to hear them in an Oriental Market), but it would have been nice to have at least one employee on the clock who was fluent in English for those of us who unfortunately took five years of French. Additionally, not one of the five employees I encountered was friendly-- not even the female cashier who was at the register as I checked out. Basic eye contact & a smile would have been appreciated. Perhaps there was a language barrier & she was afraid I'd initiate conversation and/or it's a cultural aspect-- who knows. Perhaps I'm too picky-- could be. \n\nAs Oriental markets go, prices here appear lower to me than that of the other markets I've frequented. The checkouts have plexiglass & accept cash, credit & debit cards. Masks are mandatory for customers & employees. \n\nThere is generous parking. Currently, no business shares the lot. Standard metal grocery carts are located in front of the store, & there are plastic carry ones stacked just inside the door. \n\nI'll definitely return for additional Spring Roll wrappers to make Lumpia, & to grab more Bao Buns (which are located in a floor freezer case near checkout). The colorful, fresh produce will draw me back in as well. Yup, this three-market chain that serves North & South Tampa, Brandon, as well as Pinellas Park, is definitely worth your time."", ""So far this is one of the only places in Tampa Bay where I can do some real shopping for Asian items. They don't have everything...at least not all the time. Other Asian groceries focus on a particular culture, so I buy 1 or 2 items and move on to the next store. MD caters to most of Asia including some Indian foods. \n\nI cook some Pinoy food, but since I grew up in Hawaii I was exposed to a variety/fusion of Asian and Polynesian food. The Filipino store in my neighborhood isn't always enough for me because they don't carry certain Japanese or Korean items for example.\n\nFinding your items is hit or miss. I have a difficult time finding the brand of yaki soba noodles I like to cook with that's usually refrigerated or frozen. On the west coast I can find it everywhere. The first few times I went to MD there was no trace of the noodle, but just yesterday I found a whole freezer door row of them. I love green tea ice cream and the first few times I went to MD there was tons of it in different brands, but yesterday there were only a few containers left. I think MD's inventory control is off.\n\nI do have to say I'm almost positive I can find more Filipino dry and frozen items at MD than my local Filipino grocery....but you can't find fresh bakery items at MD. What they do have is an impressive isle of tea and Asian drink mixes, fresh seafood, a butcher and all the Asian sauces you can think of. They even carry Hawaiian Aloha Maid drinks, but yesterday they were out of my favorite passion orange flavor.\n\nThe produce is just okay, but as with most Asian groceries you'll find items at MD that you won't find in Publix. I was so delighted to buy green mangoes that I can eat with bagoong!\n\nSo far I've only dealt with pleasant cashiers at MD. \n\nI do want to visit a few more popular Asian groceries to see what I'll find. I really do like coming to this side of town to shop because there's so much flavor!"", ""Everything you ever wanted for your cooking experience in Asian foods! We often buy frozen dumplings here and make lasso soup spicy delicious excellent flavor. Be sure to photograph the bags of dumplings that you purchased I've learned that in the past because they were so many different kinds recently tried the chicken and black mushroom very good as well as the seafood dumplings. When I make chicken soup I need chicken feet and this butcher always has The feet. Also have used many different cuts of their fresh beef needed flunking for a soup yes they had that kind of meat.Vegetables spices lots of snacks chips and frozen items as well. Be sure to buy things that have no English writing on them and try them you will be delighted and surprised.

I hope all of them are successful! It\'s great to be able to buy local products and be part of a vibrant community.

Experienced Botox-ers who can advocate for themselves may be fine. Newbies should seek out somewhere else for their first time. I\'ve had great experiences with Dr. Anne Hermann. \n\nI went for my 6-month Botox treatment the other day at SOHO Wellness Spa. I opted to try it because it\'s walking distance to my house and it advertises $9/unit Botox, which is pretty cheap. It is my opinion that they do this to get you in the door and then oversell the amount of units you need. \n\nMy experience with Cathy was more reminiscent of a used car salesman than a spa employee. She was asking me questions but wasn\'t listening to my answers as she was tending to other tasks simultaneously. She started to tell me the difference between a muscle relaxer like Botox and fillers on three separate occasions despite me telling her I\'ve had both before so I had an idea. When she asked what I was there for I said I wanted to touch up my forehead. She asked if I was interested in treating my crows feet. I didn\'t say yes or no - instead I mentioned my usual Botox doctor said she wouldn\'t treat my crows feet because of where they are located (idk the specifics but if a doctor turns down money and says she wouldn\'t do it I\'ll listen to her). Cathy marked up my face and forehead and recommended 54 units to ""get me my desired results"". For perspective I usually get 12-15 units in my forehead. I also was unsure what she meant when she mentioned my desired results as that wasn\'t something we ever discussed. I told her I was only interested in my 12-15 units in my forehead and not any of her other recommendations. It\'s my opinion at this point she become annoyed. She said that that few units wouldn\'t get me my (again) ""desired results"". I think she interpreted it as questioning her expertise? It\'s at this point she started doing some math out loud and saying ""we can take this off and do this and that and it would cost this"" but she was still including treatments of areas I had by now explicitly stated I didn\'t want treatment on. I said I was no longer interested and would just go back to my usual doctor because I wasn\'t comfortable with her sticking poison into my face if she couldn\'t listen to what I was saying. \n\nPerhaps I lucked into finding a great doctor for my first few Botox treatments. Maybe this is the usual level of service at other spas who offer Botox and fillers by a nurse. Maybe Cathy was having an off Monday. I\'m not sure. I can state matter of factly that I didn\'t feel like Cathy was 100% focused on me as a client and luckily I had several opportunities to recognize that she wasn\'t listening to what I was saying prior to letting her inject my face.', ""This spa is such a little retreat, it takes you out of the hustle and bustle of your everyday life and lets you get away and relax.

Sometimes you need a starter restaurant when you\'re trying to break in to a particular type of cuisine.\n\nStill, there are couple of things that I like about the restaurant. In particular, they have great specials -- especially their daily lunch specials, which include seafood specials as well. I also love the natural light. I find that this place is great for lunch, and maybe dinner.\n\nNow, back to this current visit and the reason why I\'m giving this restaurant an abysmal number of stars.\n\nThere was old salsa caked to the side of the bowl, ""sandy"" seats and drive by waiter service. My server even asked me from a table over if I was ready to order. \n\nI went with a half-dozen oysters. I told her that I would keep the menu because I wanted to order something later. The oysters were meaty but served improperly -- stacked. I have never experienced this before and it ruined the oysters. Not only did the leftover residue on the bottom of each stacked shell muddle the oyster beneath, the liquor from most of them drained out because the were haphazardly placed. What a bummer.\n\nFinally, I just decided to call it a day. But I couldn\'t find my server anywhere. So I just decided to leave my cash on the table and leave. \n\nOn the way out, I told the busser that my cash was on the table and thanked him. As I was backing out of the parking lot I heard someone yelling at me, ""you didn\'t pay me!"" Ahhh! There\'s my server, yelling at me (read: microaggressions). I let her know that the money was on the table, at which point she gave me the most embarrassed look in human history and apologized. \n\nWell, that experience does it for me.

Pro tip: toss it in the sauce they give you on the side (because it is to go) and it is so excellent!\n\nWe loved the crawfish - they were clean, flavorful and the medium heat was just right for our crowd.  We were underwhelmed by the side order of potatoes, mushrooms and corn.  We received two potatoes.  For $3.75 that\'s not right.  In fact, it\'s straight up b.s. to get two creamer potatoes for $3.75.  If we got a 1/4 of mushrooms I would be surprised.  So the message there is skip the sides.\n\nThe real star of the table was the two pounds of shrimp in the Cajun sauce.  We bought head on shrimp and they were a little overcooked but we think that was due to transport and sitting in the container, as opposed to being served at the restaurant.  The shrimp were beautiful, the sauce was succulent and had a nice heat that sneaks up on you.

Holy Batman the heat was off the hook the next day but definitely delicious.\n\nSo, Hieux puts everything in a butter based sauce unless you ask for plain.

I finally got to try it tonight with a friend of mine. We arrived around 7pm and it was PACKED. We ended up sitting at the bar because the hostess told us it was full service. After looking at the menu for a quite some time I decided I wanted to try the crawfish. The bartender tells me ""oh, we are out of crawfish. Unless you get a bucket."" That makes zero sense to me because either you have crawfish or you don\'t. I feel like she was trying to force me to get a more expensive option. So, I decided to just get a ""bucket"" because that was the only reason I came here was to try the seafood. According to the menu, the bucket contained 1 lb of crawfish, 1 lb of shrimp, 2 potatoes, corn, and andouille sausage. When the bucket was brought to me there was no corn. I asked the bartender if the corn was on the way and she said ""oh, we are out corn. So they gave you extra potatoes."" WHAT?!?! Why wasn\'t I told before I ordered the bucket that they were out of corn and why was a substitution picked for me without giving me any options? This irked me because I didn\'t even want the bucket to begin with. (Also, it comes on a platter and not even a bucket.) As we are sitting at the bar another server comes out and starts screaming that they were out of crawfish, corn, mushrooms, and only had a few orders of crabs left. Granted there is a restaurant FULL of people and several people on the waitlist on a Saturday night. Ok.......\n\nI ordered the Cajun flavor, extra hot. It didn\'t even make my nose run. Disappointing. They weren\'t bad but I just don\'t see the hype especially for $9/lb. I also ordered a dozen chargrilled oysters. They had potential but there was literally no butter so each oyster was stuck to the shell. I had to scrape them out with the fork. \n\nOrdered 2 frozen cocktails and didn\'t even feel a buzz. Sigh. I can check this place off my list of places to try now but I highly doubt I\'ll ever go back!

At this point I reminded her that once my left eye is a terminator eye, I want the zoom feature to be automatic, none of this squinting crap.  \n\nDr. Biscardi placed numbing drops in each eye as well as a dilating solution. I figured this was routine before undergoing these sort of changes.  We chatted for a few minutes... I suppose to let the solutions take affect.  \n\n""Which eye will be first?"" I asked.\n""I\'ll be looking at both at the same time,"" she answered.\n\nWow!  Thank you, future technology!\n\nThe lights were dimmed; my vision was squirrley at best, but who cares... these eyes are going soon anyway.  A bright light was flashed in each eye - not sure if she was taking genetic code to program my new cybernetic implants or she just wanted to see how green my eyes really are.  I didn\'t ask.\n\n""So, what\'s the verdict?  How soon can I be enjoying my enhancements,"" I asked.\n""You have a slight astigmatism and dry eye.  You don\'t need glasses.""\n""So, that\'s it?"" I asked.  I was so pissed at this point.\n""Yep, you\'re eyes look good.  I can check you again in a year,"" she offered with a smile. \n\nWHAT!  I felt like I was duped.  I hear of these people getting synthetic limbs that learn movement and I can\'t get a damn terminator eye!  \n\n""You\'re all set, have a great day!"" her secretary said.\n\nThe hell I am!  I get to wander my way through the city with blurry dilated eyes and no enhancements!  Better luck next year I suppose.', ""I called in to schedule an appointment as a new patient which was initially very helpful. I realized that I had a couple of additional questions about the office location so I called back. The second person I spoke to was very rude and when I asked questions she told me she was not a front desk person and does not normally answer the phones. At this point I decided to cancel my appointment and when I requested to do so, the person on the phone hung up in my face. I called back to make sure the appointment had been cancelled and it was thankfully. I can't imagine supporting businesses who treat you this way before you are even a patient. methinks not."", ""When it comes to healthcare, I am super picky and exponentially more stringent in my reviews than I am with a restaurant.  If you have a bad meal no big deal; if you have a bad doctor it is your health at stake.  \n\nI found Dr Biscardi via yelp, which made me slightly nervous as this is not a place I usually come to for healthcare recommendations.  But I am so glad I found her. Dr Biscardi is extremely thorough.  She really takes her time.  I have been to see her twice for regular check ups and both times she spent at least a half hour with me.  She ran lots of tests, explained what they were, why she was running them, and what the results were.  I feel that she wants to help me see well but she is also looking out for my long term eye care and health.  She is smart and able to answer my questions - and I ask a ton of questions.  \n\nI really like her personality.  I never felt pressured to buy anything.  She truly wants to collaborate with me in making sure I have the best contacts and eye glasses possible.  I feel comfortable telling her my concerns.\n\nThey have a wide variety of frame styles with something to suit everyone, though not a lot of depth to the selection within a certain style.   They are affordable compared to fancy pants boutiques.  The woman who works in the frames department knows her stuff.  She doesn't try to push something on you.  Instead she takes her time to make sure the frame actually fits your face and the spacing of your eyes.  I have been to every boutique frame store in center city and nobody has done that with me at any of those store.  This woman (sorry I forget her name) will tell you if the glasses are not a good fit for you.  They also don't try to rip you off by up selling features or lens processing that you don't actually need.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,

Our server Sandra was fast and friendly. \n\nThe bathrooms look like they haven\'t been updated since 1994. It smelled like a nursing home in there and it was dirty. They had a scented candle burning on the counter so they obviously know it\'s funky in there. \n\nWe got seated in a lovely dining room with a nice view of the bay. Sandra explained that we can order speciality items off the menu and visit the buffet for the same price. Husband ordered eggs benny and kiddo requested waffles and I headed for the buffet. \n\nAt first the buffet room looks like foodie heaven...until you get a closer look. The food is about what you\'d find at a mid-level catered wedding. Nothing exciting or really high quality. \n\nThe crab legs are served cold (is there any bigger sin?) and they were extremely salty. The shrimp tasted like they were cooked yesterday in the same salty water. I had ""prime rib"" which looked and tasted like pot roast. Powdered scrambled eggs. Croissants from Sam\'s Club. \n\nThe desserts were so sad and cheap. I went around and around the table just trying to find something that looked like it was worth the calories. One of the desserts was a half of a cupcake with whipped cream on top and a slice of strawberry. The rest looked like they were dumped out of a freezer box and sliced into small pieces. \n\nThe best thing in there was the waffles. They are light and fluffy and crispy and sweet and heavenly. I wiped a bit of syrup off my lip and the cloth napkin smelled like mildew.

To be honest, I had no idea this place existed until a coworker, Jonathan T., visited and myself and Brett N., my boss/last Tampa Bay CM, came up with places to take him. The email exchange went like this:\n\nJ: I'm planning to eat healthy while in Tampa.\nB: We need to go get Chinese pizza.\nJ: Hell yeah we do.\n\nWhen I brought up the ridiculousness of this exchange, I was basically met with, but it's Chinese pizza! Who was I to argue, I wasn't planning to eat healthy, so we put it on our list to check out. \n\nSaturday afternoon, about 12:30 p.m., and we are the only table in the restaurant. If you have little kids, they only have one high chair. I was victorious in getting it and I heard families after me ask and be told there were no more high chairs. It's a small place, so the one high chair thing isn't the most ridiculous thing ever, just a little surprising. \n\nIt's in a strip mall and the restaurant itself is a little jank, but the food is legit. They make fresh dumplings on the weekend so we had to try that. We also got a scallion pancake and this stuffed with chive dish that I could never understand what the waitress was calling it. Then we finished this order with a Mapo Tofu pizza, Chicken Terriyaki pizza, and General Tso pizza. \n\nI couldn't try the dumplings because they had pork, but everything else was amazing. Admittedly, the Mapo Tofu pizza was everyone's least favorite, but it was still good. I wasn't a fan because I don't like spicy food. The Chicken Terriyaki and the General Tso pizza were amazing. It has a sweetness to it, even in the crust. The combination just works. They also do not skimp on the cheese. The best part, these pizzas are only $10! For 7 people we walked away paying $70 not including tip and we were stuffed. We basically took home over half of the Mapo Tofu pizza. \n\nFor the price, quality, and novelty, this place cannot be beat.

Hmmmm, well, she has never failed me with her selection of restaurants, and so I was game to give this place a try.\n\nSure enough, this little restaurant on the north side of Bearss Avenue looks like a pizza / sandwich shop from the outside, but inside, the place was packed with college students in the know, as well as folks looking for good Thai food. \n\nThe first thing you should know is that nothing on the regular Thai menu is priced over $10. That includes rice bowls, noodle bowls and platters, traditional Thai appetizers, and a great mix of entrées. Secondly, they DO serve pizza......and apparently you can have them put Thai or Chinese / American food on top of your pizza. Finally, if you are so inclined, they do serve pig's feet, chicken feet, chicken lips, chicken butt, and a whole lot of things that will never go into my mouth. Sorry, but I just can't picture a chicken walking around on a pair of crutches because someone wanted to eat chicken feet! Nope, it's not gonna happen.\n\nCoty ordered a number of very tasty dishes for the three of us to share, and so we enjoyed Mei's pan-fried pork buns, pepper-seasoned fried chicken (no feet, please!), hand-cut Zha Jiang noodles in a black bean sauce, and a sliced, boneless pork chop served with a tea egg. The egg was awesome, so we ordered some more of them. Mei, is of course the owner, and she & Coty got in to a very fun discussion about Coty's upcoming trip to Taiwan as well as her experiences with enjoying Taiwanese food in New York City.\n\nI really enjoyed my meal, but was glad that I went there with people who were more experienced in ordering this cuisine.

Before I ventured home to Philly for Thanksgiving, this friend urged us to make a reservation at ITV, Nick Elmi\'s newest business venture. She happens to be best friends with Jonathan Cohen, Elmi\'s business partner, so she\'s committed to getting the word out about this place. Luckily, we managed to book far enough in advance to score one of the few tables in this small but mighty eatery. Though I haven\'t been to Laurel (Mr. Elmi\'s four-bell, fine dining spot, adjacent to ITV), the food at ITV is apparently quite different--here, a more casual but equally innovative a la carte menu. Our night at ITV was divine, punctuated by standout service (food comes out FAST!). \n\nITV is a small space. In the front half of the restaurant, seating options are limited to the bar/a high top against the window. In the back, four or five small tables in dim, intimate lighting. ITV is as much of a bar as it is a restaurant, so alcohol is very much on display here. The bar area is gorgeous and stocked with plenty of fancy bottles. Most bar-restaurant hybrids tend to excel in one area alcohol-wise, oftentimes at the expense of others. Not the case here. ITV boasts a well-curated drink list with equal care given to beer, wine and liquor. \n\nThough the cocktail menu doesn\'t immediately strike a person as exciting, these drinks have that ""fancy"" quality to them. It can\'t really be described by way of flavor, but you know it when you experience it. These are like that. Well-balanced, high-quality ingredients and super tasty. I tried the Drunken Farmer (Bourbon, Fig Leaf, Egg White) and the Kirby (Gin, Genepy, Aperol, Lime) which were both fantastic. Given the egg white, the Drunken Farmer was a bit lighter but still in line with fall flavors. The Kirby, though shaken (I believe), was on the stronger side but fruitier/more sour than the first. Can\'t go wrong. The food was still the star, though. Eats, below:\n\nHamachi Crudo, Grapefruit, Black Olive, Sesame: A-\nPerfect starter. Light and gently wakes the palate up. Delicate flavors, nice and citrusy. Didn\'t wow us, but a great first dish. \n\nPuffed Pork Chips, Sour Cream and Wild Onion: A\nFun artistic touch that you need to look out for if you\'re seated in dim lighting: the dip, spread in a crescent shape along the side of your plate. We almost missed this sophisticated sour cream and onion dip on the side! In any case, this is the most elevated pork rinds/dip combo I\'ll probably ever come into contact with. Another fabulous starter. Light and airy but still quite flavorful. \n\nBeef Fat Biscuit, Scallion Honey Butter: A\nThis one was just for my bf, but I gave it a try. Not surprisingly, it was magical. Flaky and decadent. \n\nChicken Liver Stroopwaffle, Plum Agrodolce: N/A\nBoth of us tend to dislike chicken liver. Which is a shame, because I can tell that I would have loved this preparation had my taste buds developed differently. The waffles and plum were a yummy sweet/savor combo, but we sadly had to set this one aside. \n\nSmoked Trout Rillette, Pumpernickel Soldiers, Trout Roe, Radish: A+++\nThe star of the night. I can\'t even describe why these were so good, but they were perfection. The rillette was heavenly. The bread was spongy but crispy. The roe was plain luxurious. A masterpiece. \n\nBacon and Wild Burgundy Snail Ragout, Mushroom, Jimmy Red Polenta, Soft Poached Egg: A+\nWhat a special, creative dish this was. Everything worked together in perfect harmony, here. I have a quirk where I like to eat dishes one component at a time, but this one\'s best just mixing everything together--poached egg and all. Rich, warm, hearty and bursting with flavor. My bf had never tried snails prior to this night, so it was a fantastic introduction to him. I tend to avoid polenta, but this preparation managed to touch my heart. Well done. \n\nLittle Neck Clams, Pancetta, Scallion Broth: A\nA thoughtful, yummy seafood dish. The clams were some of the best I\'ve ever had, and I typically don\'t love clams (depends on the preparation for me). The pancetta was a lovely touch, though made the overall flavor profile a bit salty. Minor complaint, though. The scallion broth, as well as being gorgeous in color, was yummy and perfect for bread-soaking. \n\nRabbit Schnitzel, Celery Root, Green Apple: A\nSimple but incredibly tasty. The light salad served atop the schnitzel balanced the dish nicely. If the idea of eating rabbit doesn\'t give you the willies, give this one a try. The meat was cooked perfectly and is fantastic with a quick squeeze of the seared lemon served on the side here.\n\nTo top off what had already been a beautiful night, we were lucky enough to meet Chef Elmi. I had asked the waitress if Jonathan was in that night (our family friend\'s friend--and he wasn\'t), but it was Mr. Elmi who came out instead! Gracious and sweet. Getting to meet the chef is always a special treat for me, but a famous Philly/Top Chef guy was just too great.', ""ITV is Chef Nicholas Elmi's newest offering on Passyunk, located adjacent to Laurel. ITV features the same great service and its dishes are similarly well-crafted, innovative, and beautifully plated, but with a much more relaxed atmosphere and a more casual if somewhat limited menu.\n\nFirst off, ITV is more of a bar that offers (excellent) food than a restaurant. Drinks occupy five-sixths of the menu, with an extensive offering of wines by the bottle and by the glass, beers, ciders, and sophisticated mixed drinks. The food menu has a limited selection (~12 to 15 items) of affordable, tapas-style mix of small plates (~$8) and slightly larger offerings (~$15).\n\nOur party of four stopped by for dinner and ordered just about everything on the menu. Small plates highlights included the beautifully plated hamachi crudo with ribbons of refreshing radish in a tangy buttermilk sauce, the intensely smokey trout rillette tartines, chicken liver and jam sandwiched between crunchy stroopwafels - a pleasing combination of sweet and savory, the delicately fried and seasonally sweet tempura pole beans, and the crackling pork rinds with a buttermilk-dill sauce, which arrived at our table still crackling and are, in my opinion, the pinnacle of bar food.\n\nFrom the larger plate selection, we especially enjoyed the shrimp in a mild cajun sauce with avocado and the sesame-crusted lamb ribs, which were tender and intensely flavorful. We also ordered the fried chicken, which was very good, but a bit on the bland side. The chicken also came with a side of cornbread, which was amazing - especially the scallion butter.\n\nThe service was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the drinks and food menus. Our waitress checked in with us throughout the meal and was attentive to our drinks - excellent service for a bar. The food comes out as it is made and is served in easily shareable portions, ensuring a steadily paced meal and good conversation as we marveled over how delicious each dish was.\n\nOverall, ITV was certainly not what I was expecting - and also exceeded expectations. Rather than a restaurant, I would classify it as a bar with a smaller but clearly well thought-out food menu and three sit-down tables in the back room. There are enough dishes that one can eat a filling and varied dinner - and the menu seems seasonal, so I imagine dish offerings may change every few months. ITV offers a more affordable and relaxed way to experience the mastery of Elmi's cooking, perfect for lighter meals and late-night bites with lively conversation.""]",0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.16666666666666666,0.0,0.9999999999999999,30.0

It's not on the menu so make sure you ask for it. I was skeptical at first when I heard about it but I'm glad I tried it. I barely even used the broth that comes with it because it was already infused with great pho flavor. It also comes with a side of hosin sauce & sriracha. The phoritto has everything that would normally comes in a bowl of pho. Brisket, noodles, veggies such has bean sprouts, basil, and jalapenos. It was easy to eat and wasn't soggy like I had expected. Will be back for more!\n\nI also order a foot long banh mi (vietnamese poboy) and it was made with lots of flavor. A friend of mine recommended me to try it with their special aioli sauce and I did. It had the right amount of spiciness to it. My boyfriend tried it and he loved it! Probably the best we've had. \n\nThis place is a convenient store with a few small tables if you decided to dine in.

Until one day I was perusing Yelp for some good pho in Mid-City.  \n\nAnd I've never looked back. They're never busy (maybe because it can be seen as a seedy convenience store, you don't really want to linger) and you have to go to the back of the store to order. But I don't mind the sketch when you taste the quality of their food. \n\nNow, I have been slightly obsessed lately with their pho. Chockful of ingredients, I was wonderfully surprised by how similar it was to my mom's delicious concoction the first time I tasted it. Rich and brothy, it was obvious it had been simmering overnight so the ingredients and flavors had plenty of time to marinate. They also gave me traditional Vietnamese herbs and plenty of bean sprouts. I also like the fact that they use the same hoisin sauce as we do at home. Best of all, you feel satisfied afterward and don't feel the need to drink lots of water since it's not laced with MSG.\n\nTheir fried shrimp po-boy done Vietnamese style is also really really good. You don't get tons of shrimp, but the shrimp is perfectly fried. Plus it's a different flavor from the traditional po-boys so I'll get this when I want something different. Wasn't a fan of their bun bo hue. The meat was a little grisly and there wasn't enough noodles. Broth was deep and flavorful though. \n\nOne star off because sometimes they're brisk and seem to be sick more often than not. And sometimes they will overcharge you for things. So check the register to see what they're ringing up."", 'Eat-well Food Mart is a convenience store that also happens to serve Vietnamese food in the back. Located on the heart of Canal, it embodies the all cliche keywords: a hidden gem, a hole in the wall, a local favorite ... all in one package. There is no doubt if I lived nearby that I\'d be going here all the time.\n\nHad it not been for the large window decals of ""Vietnamese Pho"" or ""Banh Mi"" I would have missed this place completely. There is little parking (beyond the street) to speak of and the area could be considered a bit sketch. All sorts of characters are coming in and out of here at all times. Inside the place looks like a convenience store found at any gas station but the real action is in the very back. Look for the food photos and the kitchen counters and one will find all sorts of goodness here. Order something and grab a seat out front where there are TVs playing.\n\nI had the pleasure of ordering for a group where we ordered several ""regular"" (aka dac biet) banh mi, summer rolls (goi cuon), fried dumplings, the infamous phoritto (pho cuon), finished with some a few Vietnamese iced coffees and sodas. It was around $70 for everything and because it was a convenience store, that meant other snacks were available and they accept credit card.\n\nWe loved everything. The bread for the banh mi was airy and fluffy, which meant there were no cuts to the roof of the mouth. The dumplings were crispy and tasty and the summer roll was very average. The real surprise was the phoritto, which despite the gimmicky feel was actually exactly like pho in a wrap. The dipping broth was particularly excellent and the wrap was packed full of tasty ingredients (pho noodles, cilantro, onions, beef slices, and an *extra* egg). It was far and away the most expensive item at $9 but I don\'t know of too many Viet places (let alone convenience stores) that sell something like this.\n\nLastly the husband and wife duo who own the joint deserve all the kudos. They were polite, extremely friendly to all who came in, and took the time to ensure my order was as close to perfect as can be. I hope that all of my future visits to NOLA will include a trip to this fantastic biz.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0

I\'m pretty certain that meaty phó is a whole other ballgame, what with the meat drippings seeping into the soup and adding that bit of unctuousness you\'re never going to get with a vegan version. But there I was freezing cold and do you know how hard it is to get a big bowl of vegetarian soup in this city?\n\nStarted with the spring rolls, because I can\'t ever pass those up. Vietnamese spring rolls are in my top 20 things to eat, seriously. And then came the enormous bowls of soup that warmed our souls that chilly afternoon.

But now that I\'ve met Lilly\'s, I\'ve seen the light... These are some serious sandwiches! They aren\'t shy with the protein and what makes this sandwich more flavorful is that they slice the tofu up really thin before marinating and frying up in what I believe is lemongrass and various spices. Add on some soy sauce and super-tangy but flavorful slaw and you\'ve got the best damn banh mí this vegetarian has ever had. It\'s also large (think: 6"" po boy) and at a very fair price. \n\nNeed something a little heartier and/or hotter? Veg heads take note: there are loads of vegan options (including pho).

We were not allowed to go back into the room with our pup. We waited in the lobby and filled out some paperwork. A vet tech came out to ask us a few questions and let us know about their ""Puppy Plan"". For a little over $700, the plan covered essentially everything needed in our dog\'s first year of life such as the neuter/spay surgery, vaccinations and boosters, and check up visits. We took advantage of this plan and found it to be VERY worth it because the first year can really add up.\n\nOur pup went back for his first check up and after, our vet Dr. Ellen M. came out and let us know that everything looked normal and that he was healthy.

On Monday, a month later, I had to take my dog to an emergency room for the same problem. When I arrived I was told that the dog had an intense infection and the skin would need to be soaked & scraped off. The emergency vet told me that had this been treated correctly an infection wouldn\'t have occurred.

I'm a member now. How did that happen? Lol. It happened because I ended up loving the class and my results that much! It's nowhere near my house, so I have to go fifteen minutes out of my way to get there, but it's worth it in my opinion.  \n\nLet me begin by saying that I'm already a moderately active person. I work an office job during the day but I exercise at a regular gym at least 5-6 times a week. I normally do a mixture of weight training and cardio when I go. I've also recently started adding yoga and Pilates once a week to my routine to develop a stronger core. So do I NEED Orange Theory to lose weight? I don't (because I've lost several pounds on my own already), BUT I love their concept of targeting your maximum heart rate zone and believe it will give me the extra push I need to lose these last few pesky pounds. I do have a Fitbit already and use it to monitor my heart rate, but it's a lot more fun when you're in a class setting with a personal trainer and can see your results from the Orange Theory heart monitor on the screen. It made me feel really motivated to stay in the orange zone, which is the recommended zone (based on your stats) to really burn fat.\n\nThe class is a mixture of interval training with cardio and circuit training with weights. It's not for everyone because my fiance tried it with me and hated it lol. However, he has never been a fan of instruction while I've done guided classes for years. It passes by quickly! I recommend trying out one class because it's complimentary and they will loan you a heart monitor. I really like that your results are emailed to you at the end of each class. Some people do complain that it's pricey but you truly get what you pay for and health and fitness are definitely something that are worth the splurge! It amazes me how people are willing to spend hundreds of dollars per month on eating out, cable TV, shopping, etc (you get the idea) but cut corners on health/fitness and only be willing to spend a few bucks on a typical gym membership. At the end of the day, you really can't put a price on the sense of accomplishment you get after you finish a grueling workout that challenges you, or the feeling you get when you look in the mirror and are happy with your physique and progress. You only have one body, so why not take care of it?"", ""Where was I before Orange Theory? Oh that's right, on my couch drinking wine every night complaining about not being in shape. I had a friend that praised this place and after awhile when one popped up in mid city, I decided to give it a try. Initially I said no because of the price, but once you calculate the cost it's really not so bad. Health is wealth baby. Immediately from my first class, I knew I had made a good decision. Not only was the staff extremely welcoming and personable, but I loved everything about the concept. It literally pushes you to work harder and get in shape. I don't have the drive to do it on my own, so fortunately this was exactly what I needed. I've been coming for 3 months now and no workout has ever been the same. I love the energy when u walk inside. For people like me who have extremely hectic and inconsistent work schedules, this is perfect. All you do is download the app and you schedule according to what works best for you. They have classes all day at all different times. If your wondering about bringing headphones or making a playlist, don't bother. The instructors have the music bumping when u walk in. I haven't taken everyone's class, but Brandon, Jeff, and Josh's music selection definitely will have you in the zone. Everyone needs a little trap music in their life lol. If I haven't convinced you by now, then go in and see for yourself. They willingly will give u a walk through and let u do a trial class. Thank me later!"", ""OTF and I had a rough start. When they initially opened it was impossible to get into a class, and I also didn't understand the whole wait list concept, so it was a frustrating initial few months. That being said, they have a come long way! It's now pretty easy to get in, provided you sign up relatively ahead of time, and you can also schedule classes way in advance courtesy of the app. \n\nThe classes are fun and always a little bit different which is nice. I've enjoyed all of the instructors and they have great attitudes and work hard to keep the class high energy;while also keeping you safe with the weight movements. The music is fun, and I like that it's dark in there relatively speaking, since I look disgusting when I work out and don't want to seen by anyone.\n\nThe cons? During the summer the room feels super stuffy and stinky. It doesn't feel like there's very good circulation in there, and while it wasn't really noticeable during the winter & spring...now you can tell. It is stanky. Also, they have this 12 hour cancellation policy which is both a pro and a con. You can't cancel after 12 hours or you lose a class/pay a fee; but it does motivate me to actually go because I am cheap.

Occasionally, you will run across a place that will try to re-invent the wheel, causing something to get lost in translation. Not the case here.

They were a hit at home; all have been eaten.\n\nI cannot wait to try other items on their menu!', 'This place had good reviews on Yelp, unfortunately it was average for me.

I had to call about 5 times before I got anybody on the phone.  MMMkay.  They are able to fit me in at 6 as long as the restaurant can change our reservations to 7:30.  Great.

So anyway, she points at my pregnant belly and says ""I think I have you next.""  I say, ""I was going to tell them I had to leave.  It\'s almost 6:20.""

The facilities were ok, but the real problem was Roberta.\n\nOh, Roberta.  I am hesitant to trash someone\'s ability to practice her chosen profession, but I would hate for someone to waste $100 and an hour on this massage.    The word that comes to mind in describing the massage is unskilled.  It honestly felt like my husband (who is an attorney, not a massage therapist) rubbing cold sunscreen on me.  It was weird when she started with my feet, and it just got worse.  I was laying there thinking, ""What is she doing?  Is she a professional massage therapist?  Was she trained?  Can I stand this for a full hour?""  At one point she had my hand pinned back to the middle of my back.  It wasn\'t painful, just annoying.  When I felt her pressing into my kidneys, a big massage no-no, I knew it was time to go.  \n\nI decided that I would tell Roberta that I had to go to the bathroom.  I came back and explained that it just wasn\'t working for me.  Frankly, she did not seem surprised.  I would guess this was not the first time it happened to Roberta.  When I checked my watch back in the locker room, I realized that I had only been in the massage for about 20 minutes.\n\nI asked to speak with the manager.  I told her that I have been to a lot of massage therapists at different spas in Philly, and I had never ever even considered walking out in the middle.  I told her that Roberta\'s touch felt unskilled and amateurish.  I asked whether they had confirmed that Roberta had formal training.\n\nThe manager responded that Roberta had several years of experience, which is not the same as training.  The manager swore that Roberta had regular repeat customers.  Maybe it was just a bad match between me and Roberta, but, like I said, I have had a lot of massages and this is the first time I ever considered leaving.

It reminds of the amazing food court that was rebirthed at Union Station in Washington, DC, a few decades ago. \n\n30th Street is now both a high functioning contemporary transportation center and a ""Please Touch"" museum in the heart of America\'s first capital city.

When my girlfriend brought my dog 5 minutes before the scheduled appointment, they said they didn't have my dog scheduled for that time and didn't have any availability for grooming. My girlfriend left and called me. After patiently walking through the owner about their scheduling mistake, she had the guts to act like she was doing me a favor and tell me that because it was 15 minutes after my scheduled appointment at that point (the lateness of course which was due to their own efforts), they could only do a brush out.

I am not ashamed to admit that I like to satisfy my craving at Olive Garden. I know the OG gets criticized for its ""Italian"" food, but I still like it, so get over it already. Anywho, I have been trying to expand my restaurant repertoire, so I decided to research some authentic Italian food restaurants.\n\nI looked here on Yelp for the highest rated Italian restaurants, and came up with a few options. After looking at reviews, menus, and location, I was most interested in Gio\'s. I read that the location was tucked away in a strip mall and a little hard to find, so the tip to look for Gold\'s Gym was helpful. I just took I-275 to Busch Gardens, turned right on Florida, then right on Waters, and it is on the right before Dale Mabry.\n\nThe outside of Gio\'s has an awning and a little bit of outside seating. Once entering, we were greeted, and promptly led to a table. It was lunchtime, and there was only one other table occupied. The dining room is fairly small, but makes good use of the space. There are wine bottles lining the wall, and a piano at the front, which is played on the weekends. The atmosphere felt a little classy actually, with dimmer lighting, a flower on each table, and nice tablecloths.\n\nAs I always do before going to a restaurant, I checked out the menu online to see what I would order. I had narrowed my choices to two pasta dishes, the Linguini Di Mare (Seafood linguini. Linguini with shrimp, calamari, clams, mussels and scallops in white or red tomato marinara sauce) and the Linguini Alla Vongole (Linguini with clams. Linguini with fresh clams in a red or white wine sauce). However, when I heard one of their specials was lobster ravioli, I promptly changed my mind. \n\nWhile waiting for our entrees we were brought bread and house salads, which come with lunch entrees. The bread was soft thankfully, because I hate getting bread where the crust might break my tooth. The house salad was very good, containing mixed greens, carrots, and their homemade dressing. Additonally, we ordered the Bruschetta Al Pomodoro appetizer (Thinly sliced fresh baguette brushed with olive oils and garlic and topped with fresh chopped tomato and basil). I really liked my lobster ravioli, which was done in their princess sauce, and contained a nice amount of filling. There were five ravioli, which was a good portion for me. My boyfriend ordered the Vitello Millanese (Veal dish. Pounded veal lightly breaded and topped with homemade bruschetta), and came with a side of bowtie pasta. \n\nThe lunch prices are pretty reasonable, I think our entrees were about $13-$15. We took a peak at the dinner menu, and those items are quite pricey for us (in the $20s). The service was very good, and we had several different people remove finished plates and refill drinks. We will definitely go back for lunch.']",0.75,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.0,1.0,30.0

I\'ll come back here for the sweets, but more than likely not buy anymore produce. \n\nPrices are really high on some items. Like REALLY high for breads to be more specific .. etc\nEven on things that are ""all natural"" not even organic. \n\nC\'mon, be serious Sprouts. Your shit is going to rot or get freezer burn when nobody buys it because the price is ridiculous. \n\nIt\'s literally a very mixed bag here so they get a 3.', ""Why 5 stars? Because I already know I'll be a regular.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nI didn't know much about Sprouts, but I read a few articles about it as they prepared to open, and I knew I'd be visiting as soon as I could. If a place near my house opens that has groceries, especially specialty and/or healthy groceries -\xa0I'm going to be there really often.\n\nMy first visit was the third day of Sprouts being open. If I was claustrophobic, I may not have made it out of there alive. I don't think I've ever seen this many people in a grocery store. But I pushed through the crowd and definitely saw plenty of great stuff! Whether you're looking for specialty groceries, organic produce, or fresh meals you can simply heat up - you'll find it worth your time to fight through the new store crowds.\n\nI ordered the italian trio sandwich and was a bit off put when I got home to see that it was on very basic wheat bread, and that it included mustard, which was not noted on the menu board. My wife ordered a panini, and I was so jealous, that I returned the next night to order one of my own.\n\nThis time, I went with the caprese panini, but I added the meat from the Italian trio. I can't recommend this combination enough - it was amazing.\n\nI do want to point out that the sandwich ordering process seems a bit convoluted. There are little ordering sheets for when you order something custom, which is confusing and definitely seems like what you have to use for any sandwich. There are different types of these sheets, which adds to the confusion.\n\nWhen the sandwich maker is putting your order together, they don't do it in front of you. They take your order, and head to the back, and out pops your sandwich a few minutes later. They did not ask me for any clarification on my order during either visit, hence the unwanted mustard and bread on my first round. Also, it took an inordinate amount of time to make my sandwich on the second night, but I'll chalk that up to it being their first week open. It was just frustrating to see 10-15 employees on the other side of the counter, but only one making sandwiches. Again, we'll chalk these issues up to the first week blues.\n\nIn the long run, the only bad thing about Sprouts opening is that I feel like there's going to be a casualty in the neighborhood. Between Publix, Whole Foods and even Abby's... can all of these survive in such a small area? I don't know, but I'm going to enjoy them all as long as I can."", ""If you are going to dream about something here at Sprouts, it's those prices on the produce. Wow I can definitely tell the difference.  Please oh please come to Wesley Chapel. It would be wonderful.\n\nAnother dream come true are the raspberry lemonade cupcakes with lemon curd inside. Wow, yes so happy I picked them up.\n\nI came here at 9pm on a Saturday. All I could think of was who comes here on a Saturday night? I got over it and was happy to see the selection of produce and the items I picked up. \n\nI also picked up the biggest scallops ever and it was an awesome price for sure. My pomegranate seeds were more than half off than the price at Publix too.\n\nThis store is a winner in my eyes. Too bad I'm Not ALWAYS in the area, but when I am, I am for sure stopping here.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

Yup, I know that\'s weird. \n\nRestaurant: I was very bummed when their Cole location closed. It was a favorite haunt for my old co-workers and one of our favorite places to have ""choir practice"". But the Fairview location is HUGE and beautiful. They can accommodate very large groups.

They can always get us in and don\'t seem to mind our large horde of loud Italians and squalling babies. They have a large, nice patio with plenty of shade for the summer months. \n\nThe food is pretty good. Probably my least favorite thing about the whole experience.

I\'ve been to Bury the Hatchet twice now. Once for a special event, and again with my friends and family. My most recent visit included 4 of us, so we were paired up in the same lane as another larger group of people (because I think they want 10-12 people per lane). At first, we were apprehensive about this, because we saw 8 other people getting paired up with my group of 4, so my group thought we would get overtaken by the other group ,and our axe throwing time would get minimized, and we wouldn\'t get as many chances to throw. After 15 minutes, we realized that was not the case. The Axe Master made sure that everyone was participating, and quickly, so that we all had multiple chances to through, often, over and over again. \n\nWe started with a game called ""get off my court"" which basically means 2 people go head-to-head, 1 shot, and the winner stays in the lane to throw again, against a new opponent, as the loser exits the lane. This was a good quick way to get us throwing the axes to get used to the technique and feel, but also to give everyone plenty of turns. After maybe 30-45 mins of this, we played a new game of boys vs. girls teams, and the team with the most points wins. This was really fun also, and even though it split up our groups, it was OK since we all bonded fine and had a great time. It was a great team building experience. I would have rathered we played a ""bracket style"" tournament where I can compete against everyone else to have 1 winner. We did this at Urban Axes and I liked it better.\n\nBut overall, I love this activity, and this facility. I think Bury the Hatchet is better than its competitor Urban Axes in north philly because Bury the Hatchet has a more social trendy atmosphere.There are TVs to watch the game, cozy couches/chairs to socialize and hang out while others are throwing axes, and BYOB refrigerators near every lane. Also, the layout of the place has all the axe lanes around the edge of the room, leaving the middle of the room wide open for socializing, instead of the competitor whos layout is more like parking lot style lanes where you walk down each row of lanes. \n\nI love axe throwing, its my new favorite activity over bowling, ping pong, darts, etc. Go on the website, reserve your spot early, because it fills up and sells out fast. Usually $35-$40pp for 2 hrs. Totally worth it, I love this place! Tip: BOYB and BYO Food. There are pizza menus there, which you can order pizza delivery near by.

Obviously I had a bad experience, and I am sure some of you had great experiences here.  But mostly importantly, I want to share my experience to help those who got misinformed or recently had a disservice at Ironwood so you know your options when things go south.\n\n\nWHAT HAPPENED?\n\nLong story short (still pretty long so keep reading if you think it will help, otherwise skip to the next section), both of my moles removal wounds did not heal right and got staph infection, which was determined by another medical facility through a culture test.  Ironwood Dermatology refused to acknowledge that my wounds were inflected.  Instead, they said the wounds were not inflected, and all wounds have staph bacteria, so it\'s normal.  While I tried to seek for second option from another physician outside of Ironwood, they stopped me from doing so by telling me that they knew the situation the best and would not want me to get a check-up by another clinic or hospital.  So they wouldn\'t give me a referral.\n\nAfter a couple weeks later with the wounds not being healed, I contacted the other hospitals and clinics and hoping to schedule an outside opinion, and unfortunately all of my requests got rejected because no one wanted to touch my wounds due to legal reasons.\n\nI revisited Ironwood many times while I was struggling, and usually an assistant would do the check-up, but never the Doctor himself (Trout).  At one point I finally demanded to have Trout to take a look at the wounds, he actually said ""I didn\'t know this turned out like this"", but still decided to wrapped the wound back with new patches and not do anything else about it.  Note that it costed me extra $30 just to see him, and he did the same exact thing that the assistant had done; by doing nothing.\n\nFortunately I have connections in medical field so I got a Surgeon involved, who then determined that my wounds were indeed bacteria infected wounds and also considered as ""defected wounds"".  \n\nNow, a doctor typically won\'t tell you this is a malpractice, otherwise they will have to attest against the other doctors, and most of them don\'t want to go that route.  So ""defect wound"" is the safest way for them to tell you ""this is not done right"" and still staying out of trouble.  Anyway, the Surgeon performed the surgery by cutting out the rotten meat.  One of the wounds healed within a week, while the other one still have a bit ""leaking"".  This ""leaking"" is caused by ""undissolved stiches"", according to Behr, who took care of Trout\'s mess several months later.  Sound familiar from other reviews so far?\n\nAfter the wounds were healed, I got a hold of a medical malpractice attorney, who determined that this would be a $60,000 to $70,000 lawsuit, but since no doctors would attest against another doctor in the same state, we would need to get two doctors out of state to do this job.  To do that, it would cost me $4,000 out of pocket in advance.  Trout is lucky that I was only a student at that time and I didn\'t have $4k.\n\n\nWHAT I WOULD TELL MY LOVE ONES TO DO:\n\nSo here are a few things I would tell my kids or my parents if they have similar experience (I cannot advise or recommend anything to readers):\n\n1.  It\'s okay to have a small procedure done at Ironwood for biopsy purposes.  If any physician here decides to ""go-large"" on your biopsy wound due to a skin cancer concern, MAKE SURE YOU REQUEST A REFERRAL TO SEE A PLASTIC SURGEON.  This was the biggest mistake I made; assuming all doctors are equal.  I am sure some dermatologists are great, but many of them don\'t receive enough surgical training.  DO NOT TAKE THE CHANCE, GO SEE A REAL SURGEON FOR YOUR OWN SAKE.\n\n2.  If the damages are already done, make sure you record everything.  Date and time, etc.  Keep all your records.\n\n3.  You have every right to seek for outside opinion.  If they refuse to refer you, ask them to put that in writing or just record the conversation with your cell phone.  You need to have this documented in case you want to pursue legal action.\n\n4.  If you are really in pain, just go to an emergency care.  Yes, you will have to pay for it, but better then dying with infection.  I hesitated and delayed the treatment for more than a week.  I hope you don\'t make the same mistake.\n\n5.  Many people actually don\'t know this but if you can\'t afford a lawyer, you can still report a doctor at Arizona Medical Board.  Sometimes a clinic might decide to settle your concern even without getting a lawyer involved.  AZ Med. Board actually takes those issues seriously.  With enough issues reported, the doctor will be under heavy reviews and they do NOT like that.  I didn\'t know this back then, and it\'s too late for me to report Trout since my case already passed the mark.\n\nNOTE: I am not in medical or legal field, just sharing my experience here.  Please consult with a medical or a legal advisor first before implementing any of the methods above.', 'I went to see Dr. Behr because I was concerned about a red blotch on my face. She came in and spent literally 1 minute looking at me then said it was normal and that I should use sunscreen. She never even attempted to look at the rest of my skin which any good dermatologist always should do and she never asked if I had any questions before she suddenly left. Even more disappointing is that she charged my insurance over $200 for the appointment.', 'I had an appt with Dr. Glassier scheduled to check a purple/black irregular mole that developed very rapidly on my chest.  I checked in and waited.  And waited.  A man and woman who came in after me and sat next to me began talking.  He was apparently a friend of the doc, assuring his girlfriend that despite not having an appointment, he would get her in to inspect the pinhead-sized white dot on her forearm.  Although I had an appointment and had been waiting a good 45 minutes, they were called in ahead of me.  I was then shuttled back to a room, where after waiting another 20 minutes, a tech came in, looked at my mole, told me it was likely genetic and cosmetic, and sent me on my way.

I have never been treated so badly.\n\nDishonest:  We booked a room with a Queen bed and a couch pull out for our friends who would be joining us.  We had much to do so weren\'t worried about spending too much time in the room and being cramped.  After the website has you pay for the room it says that you will be charged and extra $25/per person/per night, if you have more than two people.  We were going to have 4 adults.  So, the difference between the REAL cost of that room, that was very underhanded, and just upgrading to the next size was very close.  \n  So, I take it upon myself to call and clarify over the phone.  I asked very specific questions and got a solid quote over the phone from the owner Nancy.  Bottom line was, they weren\'t going to charge us the extra $50/night.  How nice.  But, not really. They did charge us at the end and said they have no reason to believe that I was telling the truth about the conversation we had.  Wow, i have never been called a liar.  I was floored.  Nancy went on to try and ""prove"" her case against me....(guess the customer is never right in their business).  Nancy said she had no record in her notes that we had the conversation. How convenient for their end of the deal. Yet, I have it on my email notes with date & time & exact amount she quoted.  I remembered precisely because I called my husband to tell him the ""good news"" after I got off the phone with her.\nMore dishonest tactics but I\'ll move on.\n\nInappropriate: I came in late the night we arrived so hadn\'t met the owners.  I show up at breakfast and get the ""evil eye"" from Nancy.  I assumed she was a guest who was in a terrible mood. No problem...I move on and look around to get an idea of how this B&B worked.  I asked, very politely, ""so how does this work?"" since I didn\'t see anyone who was running the show or welcoming me as a guest.  Nancy huffs at me under her breath and starts to explain how ""the guest is to ask the owner....."".  She refers to herself as ""the owner"" several times yet never introduces herself or welcomes me.  I then realize that she IS the owner and I actually feel a little bad for asking how it works, so as not to embarrass her I say I haven\'t been to too many B&B\'s. That was me being too gracious, again.  I have been to enough B&B\'s, I\'m from the Napa area for goodness sake.  Enough B&B\'s to know that I am supposed to feel welcome, not as if I\'ve intruded in someone\'s home.  She never smiles at me.  Yet, makes it very obvious that she is quite happy to have all the other guests.  It was like a joke.  I truly looked up at the ceiling to see if I was on some kind of hidden camera show.  You know, like Boiling Point, or something.  One of those shows where you are so badly treated and they test you so much to see when you will break.  She is like this the entire weekend.  It was unreal.\n\nThen she starts taking part in a conversation about politics over breakfast.  I\'m no stick in the mud and want folks to have their breakfast conversations but that is just inappropriate.  And, I wasn\'t the only guest that felt that way.  But, since Nancy so aligned with the political viewpoint of her 4 other guests she carried on.  I got past it but another couple was seriously disturbed.\n\nI can go on for so long but no more time.  Kids calling my attention away.  I imagine you get the jest.\n\nDon\'t go here!!  And, spare your friends and family and remind them not to go here either.  You might be one of the few lucky folks that the owners decide to like....but if you are not, you are going to be in a world terrible treatment.  So bad you think it\'s a joke.  \n\nI\'ll say it again, I\'m still perplexed as to why they are running a B&B.  \n\nI sure hope this saves you from having the terrible weekend we all had.', 'The owners are horrible.\n\nAnd, you\'re paying way too much for what you get.  Location is pretty good. The \'mansion\' is what you would expect in the district, but nothing special. You will pay top dollar for a ""large"" room that  is actually tiny and cannot accommodate the number of people that they claim.\n\nI am no local, but lived in New Orleans for 2 years.  The owners of this place are from NY and know nothing about the area.  They\'re also rude and incompetent.  INCOMPETENT.  DISHONEST.  Don\'t trust their website. \n\nIf you have a chance to go to New Orleans, good stuff. Worst time is Mardi Gras, best time is Jazz Fest.  And -- without children, stay in the Quarter close to Royal if you\'re young.  With children, stay Uptown by Loyola and Tulane - close to St. Charles (where the trolley runs to downtown) and find another b and b - there are plenty -- unfortunately, not many in NOLA or outside the SF bay treat yelp as the authority, so it\'s hard to judge.  I\'m telling you though, this place sucks big time, sparing you the details.\n\nJust don\'t stay at this place.', 'I meant to write this when we stayed at Sully Mansion in May, but put it out of my mind until someone asked me about where we had stayed on our NOLA trip and if I would recommend it. Short answer, absolutely not.  \n\nWhen I stay at a B&B, I am used to a welcoming, homey experience. That is why one would choose a B&B over a hotel. That being said, it is incomprehensible that Nancy runs a B&B. She is so cold, unwelcoming, and downright rude, that we seemed to be a burden to her, not paying guests at her venue. Blaring music woke us up at the crack of dawn, drawing us to a mediocre spread for breakfast (average baked goods, cold, bland eggs and cereal). We attempted small talk as we were being stared down at the table, to which Nancy responded that she\'s ""so tired of having the same conversations."" Perhaps it was our age, as she was equally as nasty to our friends staying there (we\'re all in our thirties) but ""delightful"" according to my parents who came by to meet her. When I needed an extra towel, I received a condescending lecture on properly closing the shower curtain (also, why did I need to explain my request for an extra towel?). \n\nThe accommodations were spacious but not luxurious, overpriced, and not worth the hassle of having to deal with Nancy. Despite the ideal location uptown, we will never stay here again, nor recommend this to our friends (many of whom make multiple and/or annual trips to New Orleans).']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,30.0

There was SO much lobster meat in there, it could\'ve been a meal. But we had just begun. Pumpkin & farro salad - came recommended, and with good reason. Grilled pumpkin, surprising and delicious, with a dressing that was refreshing without being too heavy. Three meatballs COVERED in a dusting of shaved ricotta. These meatballs were nice a big, a little tightly packed, but still tasty with the abundance of sauce. We also ordered a side of brussels sprouts, a special of the night, with capers, salsa verde, and MORE shaved ricotta - a real delight.\n\nFinally, our entree - a special of the night, the braised beef shoulder over creamy polenta and broccoli rabe. Confession - the broccoli rabe was the only thing the servers brought that didn\'t rock my world. It tasted almost chemical-ish, like it was cooked under butane or something. HOWEVER I just pushed it aside, and focused on the velvet beef shoulder, which fell apart when you looked at it, and the polenta, which soaked up all the juices like the tastiest sponge. \n\nThe servers were incredibly attentive and worked together seamlessly, without hovering. The pace was timed perfectly, and the whole experience was simply executed expertly. \n\nThis is worth the trip, no matter what neighborhood you live.', ""I can't tell you how happy I am to finally have a great Italian restaurant in the neighborhood!

At this time, reservations are not accepted. I kind of like it -\xa0there aren't many places that offer first come first served, so Carina is perfect for a night when you didn't plan ahead but still want a nice dinner.\n\nThere is a short list of cocktails and also red, white, rosé and sparkling wine, which you can get by the glass or bottle. The menu is broken into starters, salads, pastas, mains and sides. We wanted to try a little of everything so we ordered the meatballs, pumpkin salad, tagliatelle with bolognese, shells with crab, branzino and broccoli. \n\nI thought all of the food was nicely prepared and presented and tasted great. I love a good plate of pasta and neither of our pasta dishes let me down. The shells may have won out by a small margin -\xa0the tomato sauce was just spicy enough and I loved the toasted breadcrumbs for some texture.

They rushed the parts they needed over to the shop and stayed an hour after closing time to get my major issue fixed. Unfortunately, the problem was bigger than what they had anticipated, so I was back in the shop when they opened the next morning.

Of course I wanted all 38 flavors that they offer but I had to be reasonable! What helped was that they offered free samples and I finally decided on cheesecake and salted caramel. I got it in a cup and although their gelato is a bit pricey, it was well worth it because the flavors were on point and the serving was pretty generous. They stuck a wafer roll in the gelato which gave it a nice touch. \n\nThey also have waffle cones and sugar cones including their Spizzico cones which are their miniature sugar cones. The next time I'm in the Tucson area, I will find a way to make it back to Frost Gelato. Why wouldn't I? They have the whole package-great customer service, a nice clean and spacious location with ample parking, and the gelato's top notch! 2 down, 36 flavors to go..."", ""So many different flavors of gelato, all sprawled out to see...and sample! I feel like I sample the whole world when I come in here; yet I always walk out with a cup of the same thing...Almond! Okay, every once in a while a Tiramasu, or Hazelnut....but mostly Almond. This place never disappoints, the flavors are absolutely delicious. The fruit-based gelatos are great to combat the Tucson heat, and are not as sweet as the others. (Mmmmm....mango!) The only bummer is that they don't do flavor combinations in the smaller order size. Sometimes I can't decide, and that would help! :)"", ""This place has the best gelato I have ever had. I've tried gelato before and have never found anything too special about it and could rarely ever distinguish it from ice cream or froyo. The gelato at this place is so much more different.\n\nI ordered the cherry gelato which was pretty good, but my fiance ordered the rum raisin - which I thought was going to be bland, but it was so amazingly tasty. The gelato here seriously takes like exactly what you're ordering. The place is definitely a bit pricey, but it's definitely worth it. Treat yo self.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0

The whole package is nice.', ""Still one of my favorite places to eat in the Westshore area.\n\nIt's a little embarrassing that I haven't updated my review since 2015, especially when I love this place so much. Here are the main reasons this continues to be a staple in my restaurant rotation.\n\nGUACAMOLE - The table side made guacamole is superb. The chunks of avocado give me life and it is perfectly seasoned. It's a good amount for 2-3 people, if you order it and think uh I think that feeds more than 3 people, Christina, I'm a fatty, what can I say. \n\nPair it with the superbly thin and well-salted chips and it is a recipe for addiction. They do not hold back with the salt, and I am here for it. \n\nFREE CHIPS AND SALSA - It hurts my heart when I go someplace and they don't give free chips and salsa. Please always do this.\n\nCAMARONES SALAD - Yes, I continuously get the same salad. When I have so much other turmoil in my life, I'm looking at you my one-year-old son, I don't like to branch out with food anymore. This salad is delicious and nutritious. I'm so happy to have a light option when eating at a Mexican restaurant, because I know I'm eating all my calories with those chips and guac. \n\nSERVICE - You can get in and out in less than an hour. They know how to get food out during lunch hours. You would think this would be standard at any business during the week, but you'd be surprised. \n\nICE TEA - They bring out the ice tea and give you a little carafe (well, it actually looks like a Patron tequila bottle, but carafe sounds classier), so you can replenish your own tea. They even bring sweetener to the table. I love this.\n\nDESSERT - Free churros to round out the meal. It's the perfect amount of sweet to finish lunch.\n\nThe one negative is the parking situation. It continues to be impossible to find parking in the lot in front! This is a mall so of course you will find parking close by, but you might have to walk a bit. I ended up sucking it up and valeting (which was $5 not including gratuity), because I circled the parking lot once and then said screw it. There's nothing you can do about this, but add in five minutes to your drive time!"", ""Why 5 stars? Because good Mexican food is a rare find around here.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nMy fiance and I both hail from Houston where 14 great Mexican restaurants can be found in any given square mile radius of the city limits. In Tampa Bay, this is sadly not the case. Instead, we're blessed with tons of Cuban, Latin, and South American fare that Houston does not possess. So you take the good with the bad, but when you find a place like Besito, hope is restored.\n\nBesito is far from your traditional Mexican restaurant. The menu consists of a large amount of dishes that I've never seen before. But different vs. familiar isn't important... the bottom line = deliciousness wins!\n\nAfter visiting Besito for a Yelp event during my first trip, I knew I had to return and get a full experience. The guacamole is possibly the best I've ever had. And the queso fundido is one of the most addicting substances you can put on a plate. \n\nBut the main dish was incredibly impressive to me - the Costillas al Piquin. I almost never enjoy short rib because it tastes a bit more like stew, than good ole' fashioned ribs. But these were easily the best short ribs I've ever had. I had almost sworn them off forever, until Besito saved the day :)""]",0.5,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,1.0,30.0

(back in 1995), as one of my childhood friends hooked me up with a tour, as that time he was living in D.C. and working for the late senator Daniel Akaka. \n\nIn 2011, my old boss (he\'s retired now) sent me up to the east coast for work, and I found myself working in New Jersey, & Philadelphia during the summer...........a fun & great experience, and that is how I ended up visiting the United States Mint in Philly............\nHonestly, I knew there was a mint in Philadelphia, but I wasn\'t planning on actually visiting this place, but over the weekend while exploring the beautiful city of Philadelphia, I just so happen to run into this place, so I said to myself - ""why not? I\'m here already!"".\n\nOf course since I am in the business of money, you know very well that I had to check out this place! \nNo reservations were needed, as I just walked into the joint. \nThe entire tour is self guided...........and no, you cannot just walk around freely where they make the actual money folks...........otherwise folks will be trying to stuff their pockets full of money! Lol! \n\nThe tour of the mint itself is in an elevated glass enclosed gallery area, and as you walk, you look down, and you can see the things going on with the process of making money. \nDon\'t worry folks, there are signs along the tour, and the signs will explain what\'s going on in the various areas of the building.\n\nWhile you take the tour, there was a ""walkman"" like type of thing, where you could wear on your head while taking the tour, as the device gives you a ""voice tour"" while you walk along the tour............ i\'m not sure if there was a charge for the device, but when I took the tour I elected to not to wear this, as the last thing I need is to catch some ookus (head lice) on my head!

Posible ""no photo"" rule due to security???\n\nOn the brochure I picked up from the Philadelphia Mint, let me share with you a little about the Mint Story -\n\nGeorge Washington was president and Philadelphia was the nation\'s capital. It was April 2, 1792, and an act of Congress provided for a national coinage and the establishment of the U.S. Mint.\nThe first Mint was erected at 7th and Arch Streets. As the young nation grew, larger Mint buildings were needed. The present Mint, which opened on August 14, 1969 is the fourth in Philadelphia. \nThe Philadelphia Mint is part of a nationwide Treasury agency. From headquarter in Washington D.C., the Director oversees the Mints in Philadelphia, Denver, San Francisco, West Point, and the Bullion Depository at Fort Knox.\n\nThey said that the huge machines at the Mint can work 24 hours of the day, 5 days a week making coins. \n\nThere is a process of making a coin, they are -\n\n1. Blanking\n2. Annealing, Washing and Drying\n3. Riddling\n4. Upsetting\n5. Striking\n6. Inspecting\nAnd last of all..............\n7. Counting and Bagging of the coins.\n\n A pretty cool place to visit, and I would say a ""must see"" if you\'re ever in Philadelphia! \n\nCheck \'em out gang! No can go wrong!', 'Tour is completely self-guided and is fairly informative. \n\nTour ""begins"" at a first landing that is strictly information only. There\'s a short film that runs continuously that gives you a background of the necessity of a uniform monetary system. You also get to look at some of the first pressed coins among other artifacts.\n\nUpstairs begins the modern day coinage system. We actually spent a LONG time here because the machines were all actively running so it was very interesting to watch the long sheets of metal be fed and cut into planchets, heated, cleaned, annealed, then struck. When workers caught you eye, they even waved back much to the delight of many school children that were also visiting that day.\n\nThere were also some fun games along the way if you take the time to participate (identify the coin just by touch, I Spy on US Quarters, etc). The entertainment is definitely in the details which is so easy to overlook on a day to day basis as you spend and collect money. \n\nThe gift shop does sell quite a few knick knacks and for collectors, does offer a decent collection to supplement or replace personal collections. Mom picked up some presidential quarter proofs to replace the ones she\'s found just randomly in circulation.', ""The tour is self-guided and free. Make sure not to bring any cameras including cell phones (those have cameras too). There are no lockers here so you will have to take them back to your hotel or put them in your car or whatever if you plan on taking a tour. \n\nSo unfortunately, they are not producing many coins right now so we didn't get to see it operating.

I think, for the most part, those writing these reviews just don\'t get it, or maybe even don\'t get New Orleans.  This place is a time-warp, and an endangered species.  I can understand that some people do not like old-school places like Dempsey\'s- I would suggest that you just don\'t go if you\'re built that way.  Now, to the reviewers who felt they didn\'t get quality food: I really question that sentiment, having been a regular here for at least 20 years.  In those 20 years, I\'ve never had a meal that wasn\'t at least above-average, and I can be highly critical.  I\'ll be the first to bitch the second Dempsey\'s lets me down, but 20 years of consistency is a damned good track record.  The place is like the fried yat version of Galatoire\'s.   Ok, got that off my chest- now to the review at hand.\n\nI don\'t think I mentioned it before, but Jack Dempsey\'s clientele is always an even mixture of white yats and black folks, mostly from the 9th ward, Bywater, and St. Bernard parish, with a sprinkling of occasional yuppies, guppies, and yat yuppies looking for some good cholesterol.  We\'re all sitting comfortably together, like a good gumbo. Old photos of St. Pat\'s day celebrations, TV sets, and neon signs adorn the walls.  Tables have red plastic tablecloths with huge squeeze bottles of tartar sauce and remoulade on them.  This is serious blue-collar eating, but very high quality.  \n\nLet me explain how I know this place is 5 stars- growing up in New Orleans, my parents dragged me to virtually every fried seafood joint in town, and I\'ve been to many since. Dempsey\'s blows them all away, except for one- I\'d say they\'re in a tie with Middendorf\'s in Manchac (which is really not in town- it\'s a pilgrimage, but that\'s for another review) quality-wise.  The fact that Dempsey\'s is right down the street from our house makes it even better for us.  Tonight\'s meal was perfection, as usual.  Had the ""1/2 catfish, 1/2 erstas plattah"" with a side of mac and cheese.  Perfect color, crispness, texture, and flavor.  Also had the obligatory frosty mug of Abita to go with it.  Our usual waitress, Cherine, wasn\'t there tonight.  A new waitress named Tammy served us, and she was awesome too. They\'re really all very friendly.  As we were leaving we were pushing on the door, and it wouldn\'t open. This yatty waitress says ""pull the leavah!""  I had forgotten that the door locks after 9, and you have to crank down on this lever lock that came right out of the 1950\'s.  She jokingly said, ""Ya gotta stay if it don\'t work.  At least we got a lotta food. heh heh heh heh.""  Indeed they do- great food, and completely New Orleans.', ""Old school New Orleans fare. Everything is fried and delicious, the servers are always sweet as pie.

I'd lived around the corner from this place for about a year before I set foot in it. As a vegetarian, seafood places are usually pretty low on my list of fooderies. However, I had an old friend in town and he wanted to try some New Orleans seafood. We'd made plans to hit Deanie's, but after a long day of abusing drugs and cavorting in the summer hell heat that is August in New Orleans, we decided to keep it in the neighborhood.\n\nChrist, this place is a hidden gem. The inside reminds me of the bar my dad got stoned in with his buddies post weird middle-aged dude softball league games when I was a kid, circa 1995. The only real difference is these people can fucking cook. My lady and out-of-town friend set to work on devouring a small mountain of fried seafood while I feasted on fried mushrooms and baked macaroni and cheese all the while guzziling cheap ambers and inhaling second hand smoke. I'd recommending getting a bit blitzed first as it makes the nostalgia stronger, the matronly waitresses seem that much more motherly and helps you forget that each visit moves you 3 years closer to a massive heart attack.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

La Colombe used to rock my world with some milk and sugar.  Then, I went to Portland to visit some family and accidentally discovered Stumptown coffee and my eyes have forever since seen the light.  After a week in Portland, I came back to La Colombe super stoked for espresso.  I noticed the difference immediately.\n\nHere\'s the deal, La Colombe jumped onto the early 90\'s coffee band wagon and made an acceptable product for the times.  They were successful in a town that never really had much to claim for coffee, as opposed to the NW, Italy, or the Nordic regions.  Being successful, they never bothered to continue and progress or refine they\'re product.  Nor their barista\'s training, which after the farmer and roaster is the last platform in pulling off noticeably incredible coffee.\n\nA lot has happened over the last decades, in coffee.  Todd Carmichael, one of the owners, has been too distracted (crossing the South Pole) and too lazy (http://www.esquire.com/blogs/food-for-men/worst-coffee-trends-060210) to take heed or notice.\n\nAnd it\'s easy  to see the latter when you a) check out the coffee, which is bad tasting b) check out the machinery which in my years frequenting his store has NEVER BEEN CLEANED (milk encrusted steam wands) and c) has non-transparent coffee... that is that who knows where the coffee\'s coming from... which is deceptive and typically a hint that the coffee is grown unethically and crappy.\n\nBut hey, the proof is in the pudding.  I encourage all who will read this to check out their website (which mentions coffee that tastes like ""exclusive"" ..?.. not cocoa or berries or ...ya know, real food); check out their coffee and espresso; does it have a roast date listed? Coffee has a short sweet spot after being roasted... less than a few weeks; are their beans really oily (proof of over-roasting or being too old); see how bad and unsympathetic their baristas are.  Then go to a shop like Ultimo, Spruce Street Espresso, Bodhi, or Capogiro and notice the difference.  The craziest part about the last referenced cafe is that they use La Colombe beans and due to their care for details actually pull a half decent shot of their espresso, despite the odds.\n\nWhen you care about how a crop is farmed, how it is roasted, and how it is prepared, the product usually tastes better (coors light or yards?).  Also, pretension doesn\'t equal good product and the great cafes mentioned above don\'t mix the two.\n\nI also encourage La Colombe to do a better job and give a crap about what they do and serve.  But with owners that are this out of touch and nihilistic, I don\'t see that happening.  For an interesting critique on Todd Carmichael\'s bogus article check out Chris Tacey\'s review.  It\'s interesting.  http://godshot.blogspot.com/2010/06/thank-you-sir-may-i-have-another.html\n\nHere\'s to better coffee in a town that\'s worth getting excited over.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0

But when you're feeling the need to shrug off the busy city and turn your focus inward, Yoga Child is a lovely place to recharge."", 'I have a love-hate relationship with Yoga Child.  \n\nLove: I am really enjoying the prenatal yoga classes.  Sunday prenatal yoga class has been a really wonderful way to connect with other pregnant women and get some beneficial exercise.  I always feel more relaxed and in tune with my baby after prenatal yoga, and I am hoping that some of the techniques and positions I am learning will be useful during the birthing process.  The studio is also really lovely and climate controlled (unlike many other yoga CC studios...I am looking at you Dhyana Yoga on Walnut).  \n\nHate: Yoga Child has a pretty draconian class purchasing policy.  After your introductory week, you cannot buy a single class.  You must buy at least 4 classes at $23/class.  AND, you must use those classes within 4 weeks.  The schedule of prenatal classes sucks for someone who has a typical office job.  Most of the classes are on weekdays in the middle of the day.  So yeah, I am never going to be able to make the Wednesday class at 10:30 a.m.  The only class that I can possibly attend is the Sunday afternoon class (which is the only prenatal class on the weekend).  So, when I fork over $92 for a 4 class pass, I basically need to guarantee that I will be able to go the next 4 Sundays or I will forfeit $23 for each week that I miss.  In a nutshell, the prenatal yoga class policy is extremely rigid at a time in my life when I (and probably most pregnant women) would appreciate some flexibility.', ""Back when I had plenty of time, when I was in school, both college and post-graduate, I used to practice yoga to my heart's content.  Then adulthood, full-time job responsibilities and life just got in the way and yoga fell by the wayside.  I rediscovered yoga once I became pregnant.  After I got the okay from my doctors, I started attending Yoga Garden's prenatal yoga classes.  After doing quite a bit of research, (at the time, Mama's Wellness joint had not yet opened), Yoga Garden was one (if not, the only one) that offered prenatal yoga classes on the regular.\n\nI really enjoyed those six months of classes, and I went to them right up until my water broke (and TMI, it broke right after a Sunday afternoon class - when I was nearly two weeks late - so it did the trick) and I believe the classes really helped me through my super long labor and delivery.  After recovering from childbirth, I started attending their Yoga babies class - which were equally excellent - these classes allow me to get my yoga in (when the baby allows it - ha!)  while I involve the babe in the practice - aside from my long walks, it's the only exercise I can get these days -\n\nBoth the pre-natal and yoga babies classes are really lovely.  The instructors are patient, sweet and attentive.  They are kind and conduct classes in a very calming manner - these classes also allow you to meet other women (there's always an introduction and discussion with all the participants before each class) and provide you with a sense of community and support.\n\nOnly few hiccups to the place, the studio is rather small and narrow (but it's nice to have an intimate class) and if the class is super full, they do run out of the props (pillows and support most often) - classes aren't cheap - the Yoga babies are $18 a pop - but for what they provide, it's totally worth it.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,

The crust was better as was the flavor of the pesto toppings. The calzone was quite good -- but one of the teens thought it was a bit too cheesy. Of course, he ate every bit though.

Today, on their grand re-opening day, I tried the new ""Tofu Verde"" burrito for $5. Everything on it is quality. From the deliciously fresh and soft tortilla, to the chewy marinated tofu, to the cilantro and onion, to the slow cooked wonderfully spiced beans. I inhaled it although the initial plan was to save half for later. My bad. But so worth it.\n\nI also highly recommend anything with sweet potatoes or guacamole.

The price to quality ratio is off the charts. $6 for a giant chicken burrito or $5 for a chicken mole bowl with a free drink? Killing it.\n\nLet's get into the nitty-gritty though. Mexicali is a two-person operation that offers a reasonable variety of pseudo-Mexican options. You've got your usual burritos, fajitas, and taco bowls, with a random special of a day that's usually some type of soup in a bowl (I'll get back to that later). A chicken/pork fajita with guac starts at $6, beef at $6.75. They offer whole wheat tortillas, hash browns as a rice replacement, and a yoghurt avocado sauce as options. On the vegetarian side, they've got a $4 spinach/sweet potato burrito that's surprisingly filling and the Cali which is really popular. They offer three sauces, the mild, medium, and hot, but they will give you the extra-hot if you specifically ask. \n\nThe chicken is a little dry but the pork is super tender. The sour cream scoops are generous and the guacamole is nice and fresh. They do use preshredded cheese, but it's no real knock against them since everyone does as well. \n\nBut the bowls.... hnghhhh. They've been doing a special of the day which is always $5 and they throw in a free drink, which is chicken and rice pricing. Off the top of my head, they've had chicken chili moles, chicken rojo, chicken chili verde, chicken mole poblano, and just so much goodness. It's flavorful, soft, and complex.

Four years ago, Erzulies had the last precious stock of oils from Mystic Curio, which I believe closed right around the time of Katrina (I understand the owner is happily retired in Florida).\n\nSadly, the oils no longer exist, and Mystic Curio's owner remains a cherished memory (he'd pull out an oil to recommend to you after talking to you for just a few minutes...my favorites were Musk Royale, Voodoo Nights, Black Rose and Cleopatra). But  Erzulies' oils deliver! \n\nThere is a fabulous woman (maybe the owner) who greets you as soon as you pass the threshold. She is there to answer any questions you may have and suggest various fragrances. I think she has a sixth sense and can tell what scent will work for you not unlike the owner of Mystic Curio. There's a fair amount of variety to choose from, but I zeroed in on my favorite, which I had run out of, as well as a newer oil that she showed me.\n\nYou can also get readings here as well as various other esoteric needs fulfilled. It need be reiterated that the owner is so friendly and approachable that you feel you can ask any question, no matter how clueless you are. I think it's important for one to feel comfortable with the occult (rather than frightened, that is). Nothing intimidating here!

And the perfume oils....the perfume oils!  Being an obsessive perfumista who even had the luck & grace to make a journey to Grasse, France (the mecca of perfumery) and toured some of the world's finest perfumeries,  I can absolutely say that Anna's creations are of the highest order - truly amongst the finest I have ever encountered.  Not an exaggeration.  It is immediately obvious the attention to detail that is exacted, as well as her use of the highest quality ingredients.  This is in addition to the blessings & personal, loving energy put into each and every creation that she literally hand-crafts herself.  \n\nI'm serious - you can almost literally *feel* the positivity that starts to glow & warm upon your skin when you apply them.  I don't mean to sound all cheesy (hey - I'm a heavy metal singer - for me to even write about these subjects in such a way means that this is some seriously bad-ass stuff, you know?!)  The perfumes & oils are indeed, my favorite items because not only are they absolutely INCREDIBLE smelling (OH, the compliments you shall receive, I swear, and also how lovely you will feel whilst enjoying their intoxicating bouquets) but they last & last & last & last...unlike so many other supposed 'sacred oils/perfumes' that I have purchased from differing retailers and/or brands (designer brands, even), whose scent fades within a couple of hours of application.  \n\nIf you really crave a warm & welcoming environment to shop in - in addition to the highest of high quality products & absolute integrity within the spiritual community:  your expectations will be surpassed at Erzulie's.

What it does wrong, it does very wrong.\n\nThe Foundation Room is the members only, exclusive area above the House of Blues.  Although I don't have a membership, I'm occasionally invited up with friends.  I was recently extended an invitation while attending an Irvin Mayfield jazz show (which was fantastic).\n\nPrior to going up to the Foundation Room, we ordered a couple of drinks at the bar downstairs.  While $20 for a house cabernet and a tall beer seemed pretty high, it's to be expected at a concert venue.\n\nOnce upstairs in the Foundation Room, I again ordered house cab.  I could see that the house cab was BV. Since I was familiar with the wine, and the price point, I didn't ask a cost on it.  I've worked in the service industry, and I also know that typical mark up of wine in a restaurant is about 300%.  During the course of the show, I had 3 glasses of HOUSE WINE.  I was floored when I received my bill to find that the wine was $18 a glass!  This is wine that retails in the local grocery store for $8.50 a bottle!  I could even deal with a 400% mark up considering the venue, but an almost 900% mark up on a $9 a bottle wine, is just beyond ridiculous. \n\nSo the price point of beverages is where the Foundation Room fails miserably. \n\nWhat the Foundation Room does get right is it's service and decor.  Service was fast and very friendly. The décor is really pretty with deep, warm reds and golds. \n\nI would go to the Foundation Room again because I love the décor and comfort of it, and being able to walk straight to the balcony in the show room, and have a special viewing area.  But with those prices, I'd likely walk down to the regular bar downstairs to order drinks."", ""Hmm...I ended up here after a show at HoB since my friends really wanted to hang out with the band and they had given us passes. I'm not really a velvet rope kind of girl so that part kind of annoyed me. It's a bar that charges huge prices for drink and you have to be invited in (or you have to a member or something). \n\nThe decor is cool and there was a DJ with accompanying horn player spinning an eclectic selection of music. There's a couple of different spaces (including a VIP area) to escape the music and dancers.\n\nThen there was the crowd. It was bizarre. There was a definite sugar daddy/much younger woman thing happening. Maybe it is the velvet rope thing...people seemed really stoked to be in the space. I don't know. I like weird spaces. But the crowd just didn't do it for me. My friend who got us in acted like she was in hell...until the band showed up and she got to geek out. Then all was right with the world."", 'This member\'s only hideaway with a private entrance into the House of Blues music hall is unlike any other restaurant/bar/lounge in New Orleans. I\'ve been to the Foundation Room twice and was blown away both times by the ambiance, service and food trifecta. If I were the NOLA Community Manager, this is definitely where I\'d host an Elite party! \n\nAn elevator takes you up to the crystal corridor that leads to the Foundation Room. The lounge, dining room and prayer room are all exquisitely decorated in Eastern influenced style and the walls are draped in rich, colorful fabric. Seductive lighting and plush sofas and dining chairs add to ""get relaxed"" atmosphere. The Prayer Room is said to be adorned with Tibetan temple artifacts. \n\nThe dining room intimately seats 45 and I especially like the booths with curtains you can close for privacy. Service is relaxed and casual, very refreshing for such an exclusive venue and I imagine an homage to southern hospitality. \n\nThe upscale bistro menu is full of excellent choices but nothing I\'d describe as unique. Not a knock, the food is fantastic, but don\'t expect innovative dishes or breathtaking plating. \n\nI have no idea how much a FR membership costs but am grateful to have friends who are members! If you ever get an invitation to go, say yes, you\'ll have a great time.']",0.42857142857142855,0.0,0.0,0.2857142857142857,0.2857142857142857,0.9999999999999999,30.0

While everyone one else's brain is receiving signals that say the food is juicy and delicious, all you taste is 'a single cell protein combined with synthetic aminos, vitamins, and minerals... everything the body needs' but taste buds don't desire.\n\n\nTHE SCENE\n\nI read the reviews and came here with the highest of expectations. Immediately this place began to sweet talk me. I saw the meat smoker, which was a huge turn on! The sides were open exposing delicious pink meats being slow cooked right in front of my eyes like a sexy dance! I also saw the real wood stacked out back below a large tree with branches full of REAL LIVE chickens... yes I said chickens! (BTW the way, did anyone else know chickens climb trees or am I still inside the Matrix?) As a final act of foreplay, the interior decor was just right, like candles burning around a hot bubble bath. It had that seductive gritty down home feeling I like when enjoying BBQ. The only thing missing from this BBQ romance was blues music playing live!\n\nThe chef allowed me to sample several items since I just couldn't decide what I wanted my sides to be. They'd run out of mac n' cheese, which would have been my first preference, however, the collard greens and chicken n' rice were amazing! This took my BBQ expectations even higher as I anticipated a foodgasm once I got my hands on the pork ribs I ordered. Unfortunately, this romance was not meant to be.\n\n\nTHE FOOD\n\nThe ribs were smoked to the point of tasting like cigarette ashes. I've learned since being  an active yelper than many people crave this type of smoky flavor, but it was just too much for my extremely picky BBQ palette. I would much rather have well seasoned meat with just a kiss of smoke than eat meat that should probably have a surgeon general warning label!\n\nI also don't care for BBQ sauce. If the meat is well seasoned, to me sauce is unnecessary. Yet I found myself drowning these ribs in sauce to hopefully compensate for the ashy flavor. I emptied an entire table bottle on my order, and still with little desire to eat them, I threw away my leftovers later that evening. Other items to my disliking include the potato salad and baked beans. Growing up my mother used brown sugar to sweeten her beans and that is the flavor I'm used to, but these beans tasted of syrup or molasses, which I did not enjoy. They were also practically as thick as peanut butter.\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nI'm not sure why people find this place to be worthy of 5 stars, but I most definitely do not. This brief encounter felt very much like being in a relationship where everyone tells you how great the person is before you meet them. When you finally do meet them, they are presentable, attractive and say all the right things. However, in the end, they just don't perform!\n\nI'm breaking up with you Al's Finger Licking Good Bar-B-Que I didn't lick my fingers, not even once.\n\n\nSIDE NOTE - This review should really be a 2.5, but I really liked the staff. They were accommodating, hospitable and kind. Not to mention the chicken n' yellow rice was simply amazing! So I have chosen to round up instead of down.\n\n\n2016/4"", ""I licked every finger during my meeting with Al. So, Al may I please ask you to forgive me. I mean what's a girl supposed to do when juicy, tender, delicious ribs just fall off the bone and the meat melts in your mouth? The baked beans were cooked to perfection,  Erika put her pinky toe in the spicy collards and you had my grandma's sweet tea. So please beg my pardon as I attacked my food like a savage. \n\nA quaint little house located in the heart off Ybor on the back side is where you too will find Al. It is not much to look at, but once you enter, you will forget all about the outside. I am glad I got in when I did because within minutes this places was swarming with hungry humans. \n\nThe service was great! And the food was Ohhh Sooo finger licking! How's that irony!\n\nMy only critique is Al is only open Wed - Sat. So if you want a meeting with him, get there on an open day and early. And do not wear your Sunday best. Oh and please have positive table manners!"", 'After reading the amazingly positive reviews I had no doubt I would be experiencing Al\'s Finger Licking Good Bar-B-Que in the very near future and today the opportunity presented itself. If you know anything about me it\'s that I love good BBQ and can be somewhat direct and maybe a little harsh when it\'s come to reviewing these places, in my opinion Southern Style BBQ cooked on a real pit using wood is authentic and how cooking meat was meant to be from the beginning of time or at least since man discovered fire. There have been occasions when I\'ve enjoyed smoked meats on mechanical devices that were developed either to speed up the process or feed the masses but the old school wood fired method that requires hours of patients is in a different league.\n\nThis place proves when you\'re passionate about something and willing to put in the work to make it successful the end results will be rewarding. What started in a garage feeding family members expanded into throwing a few extra pieces on the grill to feed a few neighbors it was apparent Al had the knowledge and talent to become what will be know forever going forward as a ""Grill Master"" this is not a self proclaimed tittle it\'s a fact. Once you experience this food that\'s a combination of southern style and soul food cooking you will know this is the real deal. After lunch I had the pleasure of meeting Jackie one of the family members here, it was apparent that her passion for serving only the best homemade dishes possible along with exceptional customer service is her number one priority and as impressive as this restaurant\'s accolades are it\'s all about customer service and the food. One look around validates the humble beginnings, one taste of anything here solidifies their place as one of the best BBQ joints if not the best in Florida. Demand has dictated a relocation is in the future as much as they love this location near 7th street in the historic district of Ybor City, so pay attention when you plan your visit. Now on to the food.....\n\n-Pork Ribs- Fall off the bone tender, seasoned perfectly, smoked until a smoke ring and thin bark forms on the outside sealing in the all the juices. The flavor of the wood is intertwined with the seasoning to create a distinctive fragrance you get as soon as you get out of your vehicle in the parking lot so roll up your windows if you\'re in the path of the smoke. These are the real deal. \n\n-Smoked Chicken- Wow! Tender, juicy full of flavor all the way to the bone yet not dried out, it\'s really something magical. Warning this is smoked chicken not grilled perfect to pull apart and dip in your choice of sauces yes they don\'t bathe anything in sauce here you choose your sauce and how much of it you want, for me it doesn\'t need any sauce but I did dip a few bites of the chicken. \n\n-Smoked Pork Sausage- This maybe the most unique offering here and what sets them apart from every other BBQ shack in Florida, this special blend of meat and spice is going to be a hit with any pure sausage enthusiast smoked then chopped on the butcher block and piled high yes pour on the ""hot BBQ sauce"" on this one this is a real winner.\n\n-Smoked Turkey- I love turkey and this turkey was moist, smokey and tender and oh for an added twist it came chopped like you would for a sandwich, different but delish.\n\n-Collard Greens- Hand washed, chopped daily and cooked until tender. These aren\'t your average collard greens they are seasoned spicy and you will get a warning if you order them but not an apology so be ware of this, so simple so delicious and of course there\'s a bottle of pickled peppers in vinegars not the table to splash on top - oh and don\'t forget the cornbread it\'s old school and home made as well  served up with any order of collards.\n\n-Blackeyed Peas- Seasoned mildly and cooked until they melt, Jackie assured me they were cooked from dried peas not frozen or canned there is a differences you know I could of eaten a bowl of these.\n\n-Potato Salad- Mustard based sweet and tangy this is served like everything else here no pre-measured portion controls are in place here it\'s like fixing your plate at home when youve cooked your favorite dish.\n\n-BBQ Sauces- Hot or Mild and these too are finger licking good.\n\nThere\'s really nothing more to say, if you\'re looking for good BBQ, you\'ve found it...']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

Illustrative of the menu, our choices for late lunch included:\n\n*Goat cheese stuffed poquillo pepper with arugula and clementine salad ($8)\n*Risotto with wild mushrooms, apples, hazelnuts and pecorino ($14)\n*Butternut squash ""steak"" sandwich on walnut bun with gorgonzola, spinach and maple glaze ($10)\n*Chocolate caramel tart ($8)\n*Two glasses of wine ($16)  and a coffee ($2.50)\n\nVALUE: There are  options on the menu for all people who love food from vegans through omnivores and for a bigger budget or a smaller one.  Lunch items run approx. $6 - $16, dinner items a bit more and some breakfast items a bit less.   Lunch above was about $30 /person before tax.  But we could have been enjoyed a sandwich and soft beverage for under $15 / person or soup or salad for about $10 for each of us. \n \nVIBE:  Creative blend of industrial and warm, casual, understated elegance.  The seating is divided into roughly three parts.  a) The narrow bar with high counter seating and a couple of standard height tables at the back. This is also the Civil Rights miss.  See Accessibility.  b) The front window facing section with square tables  and step up booths along the wall.  c) The kitchen facing section with standard height banquette seating and chairs.  \n\nMusic mix was classic jazz set at just the right level and was a perfect partner for the setting. \n\nACCESSIBILITY:  Level in the door, all on one level, multiple standard height seating options in dining room, mostly adequate clear aisle space. BUT the bar violates ADA equal access rules in that people using wheelchairs are denied seating in the bar.  The ADA is a Civil Rights law that is 27 years old.  The law requires disabled people be allowed equal access to participate - say as in happy hour here.  While there are two standard height tables in the back corner of the bar, the high top tables and chairs plus bar stools the owner elected to set up here block disabled user access to seating.  We were told disabled people were not welcome in the bar for this reason but could go sit in the restaurant - by themselves - while other able bodied people gathered in the bar. ""Our servers can barely get through everything is so tight, so we know disabled people can\'t use the bar.  They can go sit in the restaurant.""   Segregating any minority population of people to a separate space violates equal access Civil Rights.  The ADA is Civil Rights law. This needs fixing. Imagine if the hostess said ""We\'re sorry, but people who are Latino are unable to be seated in our bar. They can only use the dining room.""  It is the very same kind of discrimination to say it about disabled persons.  Tilt.  There is no excuse for a new place like this to get this wrong.\n\nPARKING:  Parking to the side of Richard\'s for use of diners has 25 spaces.  One accessible parking spot, although not per ADA  for van accessible with striping wrong side. Valet parking is offered at the hotel entrance too. The restaurant will validate the valet ticket.', ""This was the cherry on top of a lovely anniversary date during the time of COVID. \n\nWe parked in the covered parking which is set aside just for Richards guests. We entered through a separate door in our masks and were escorted to the elevator. Currently all Richards guest are eating on the 2nd floor so they have access to the patio. We wanted patio seating but the only Available spots were in the sun and it was 102 that day. So we opted to eat inside. This was a bit of a bummer. You're clearly in a hotel conference room with some spaced out tables. The ambiance was definitely a zero. Also, they aren't pouring any draft beers since they don't have access to kegs upstairs. Not sure why they couldn't pour it downstairs and bring it up just like everything else but.... oh well. \n\nThese were clearly COVID contributions so I detract no points for these things. Just worth mentioning that it's not as nice of an experience at the moment. The staff was nicely masked and gloved up. All guest wore masks away from their tables. \n\nFood was very yummy. We had the Fig Flatbread which was definitely my favorite thing of the night. The prosciutto was crunchy, the figs were chewy and the Gorgonzola was balanced out with honey glaze. It would make the perfect happy hour treat. \n\nI had the braised lamb. The lamb was very tender with a crisp exterior. The yogurt sauce and feta spinach was a perfect, creamy accompaniment to the meat. I loved the crispy chickpeas too. I could enjoy a lot more of those. \n\nMy partner had the ribeye which I didn't even try because my dish was so delicious. He said it was a little heavy handed with the butter but beautifully cooked. \n\nOur server very sweetly brought us black cherry/chocolate gelato for an anniversary treat (for free!). The mix ins were delicious but neither of us liked the gelato. It was very icy and not as creamy as we expected. \n\nWe can't wait to go back when things are a little more normal."", ""All in all, a true Richards experience. \n\nWe started the evening at the bar where we just ordered a quick drink while waiting for our table. Quick, friendly and perfect service from the bar. \n\nOnce we moved to our table we ordered the scallop with Sweet Potato and spicy cilantro, although this is on the pricier side of starters at $6.50 per scallop. The combination is really good and well worth the splurge even if it's for only one scallop. I do wish the 'spicy' aspect for the spicy cilantro came through but unfortunately we didn't pick up on any heat at all- this would have really taken it to the next level. We also tried the shrimp and risotto cake app, very good and flavorful. Would definitely order again. My husband also ordered the Tomato Bisque which he found to be under seasoned but otherwise good. \n\nOnto the main show. The significant other ordered the Pork Chop with charred cabbage. He actually enjoyed the cabbage to his surprise and the chop was cooked to perfection with the brine bringing out the best in the chop.  I ended up ordering the Linguine with clams and chorizo. Although I found my main to be rather boring and bland, despite all the flavor that chorizo and fresh seafood can bring. However I fully intend on coming back to try another main on the menu.\n\nNow...I can hardly type this out without having severe cravings for the amazing dessert we shared. The Tiramisu Cheesecake was undeniably out of this world good. Even my husband (who doesn't care for Cheesecake) absolutely loved it. It's served with a very good chocolate sauce, not the Hershey kind, more so a homemade milk chocolate base that leaves you fighting the urge to lick the plate clean....literally. \n\nOn a side note, they could use some better organization to their coat check process as we and another group of guests were asked to step into the cost closet to identify our coats, which was slightly alarming and unexpected....perhaps a number process would be better suited as it's less than ideal to sort through a sea of black coats hoping someone else didn't pick yours out by mistake. \n\nWe will certainly return to Richards, although I do strongly recommend reservations as the restaurant itself is on the smaller side, leaving limited opportunity for walk ins or non-hotel guests once the hotel opens and I have a feeling Richards popularity will only grow. Cheers!""]",0.5,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,1.0,30.0

Entering the gallery, the first impressions are the the metalwork doors and the walls of large, color-splashed rocks held back by timbers.  To the right is the gift shop, which is predominated by inexpensive reproductions of his paintings of children.  I was frankly underwhelmed by these, which seemed a Southwest version of the big-eyed Keane paintings of the 60s, but fortunately there is more to his work than that.  Walking out into the garden I was charmed by the quirky statuary and I walked into the gallery at the back of the garden where bullfighting paintings were displayed.  When I walked into the main gallery building I became aware of the evolution of his painting from decade to decade, that of the 40s more representational w/ sharp, clear outlines, the 50s to 60s w/ more use of the palette knife, adding texture and blurring outlines a bit.  I think that was the style that drew me most.  There are originals from all periods for sale in one room and the prices go from $2,000 to $65,000 and more.  In another room was showing a locally made NPR program about DeGrazia, following him around to various activities and allowing him to expound on his inspirations, thoughts and feelings.  That was very enlightening and made me understand and appreciate his work more, which was the point of it:  information for the uninitiated.  Interestingly, when discussing his paintings of children, he was pretty offhand, essentially saying, ""People like them, they buy them, I paint them."".  That\'s what I was responding to in the gift shop.  \n\nIn 1976, in anger at the Uof A declining his proffered donation of his paintings and at the IRS which would have taxed his heirs at the assessed value of his paintings upon his death, he publicly burned 100 of the paintings.  According to the newspaper article on one of the gallery walls, there was an outcry and he declared if he burned any more of them it would be privately.  He never painted again after that.\n\nThe gallery is very extensive and seemed to go on forever.  The architecture was fascinating, w/ varied textures including areas of the floors made of 4"" pieces of jumping cholla cactus set on end in concrete w/ the ends highly polished and some stained, some inlaid w/ stones.  It\'s well worth a wander and I\'m glad I went beyond the gift shop.  His work is not restricted to painting and drawing, but extends to stained glass and sculpture and ceramics and even some firescreens decorated w/ beads.  I\'m sure I didn\'t see everything, but what I saw engaged me.', ""The rustic DeGrazia Gallery in the Sun is such a treat even for this long time Tucsonan. The grounds are beautiful, the buildings old and full of history, and art is everywhere. EVERYWHERE! Turning from Swan on to the property, I was immediately hit with the simple, rustic beauty just from the fencing that lines the road leading to the parking lot. My friends and I learned that a wedding would be taking place in the little open air mission in a bit so we hurried over to see it first before the wedding guests arrived. The mission is so simple and unsophisticated as is everything on the property yet so full of beauty. I am a sucker for altars with pictures, trinkets, candles and written words of love so this was right up my alley.\n\nThe actual Gallery is a surprisingly large maze of rooms full of DeGrazia's art. Admittedly not a fan of the art he is most known for and uneducated about his wealth of talent in various mediums, I was so surprised at everything I saw. The looping video midway through the gallery is worth the 20 minutes it takes to watch. One really gets a sense of who Ted DeGrazia was and his love for the desert and its people.\n\nThe beautifully whimsical garden area is really a treat and as I walked throughout the area I constantly found new items and art that brought a smile to my face.\n\nI have a new appreciation for DeGrazia's art and really enjoyed everything I saw especially the bullfighting pieces and the work dedicated to Padre Kino. There is so much emotion in those pieces - pain, admiration, love and harshness. I only wish the gift shop contained a better cross section of his art instead of what he is so well known for....little children. \n\nI always thought DeGrazia Gallery in the Sun was a bit of a tourist trap but I think every person who lives in Tucson owes it to themselves to visit the property."", ""If you enjoy Native American inspired art, go.\nIf you enjoy unique architecture, go.\nIf you enjoy a free adventure, go.\n\nI drove up to this gallery one day when someone on Twitter mentioned that it was free and open over the holiday weekend.

I love this place.  On my second visit the gentleman who greets you already knew me by my first name.  \n\nCaveat:  why I would withdraw half a star - this is a ""boutique"" gym, and since it\'s Life Time\'s Diamond level you\'re gonna have to shell a bit more coin than other echelons in the Life Time family.  And due to the fact that it\'s attached to the mall (no mall entrance, please only come to work out not to cut across to Nordstrom\'s, because you can\'t), it\'s size is limited and doesn\'t offer some amenities of other locations (i.e. my home store was the size of a football field and had a kiddie pool and rock climbing).']",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,50.0

I never enjoyed yoga until I started going to Session-- so glad I gave it a shot! It\'s completely different than the yoga I\'d tried in the past at places like LA Fitness. \n\nSome classes play music.  Good music at that-- sometimes I have to keep myself from Shazzaming in the middle of class. The power yoga class is fast paced, so you get the satisfaction of a cardio workout. One of the reasons I never liked yoga in the past was that I felt it wasn\'t invigorating enough. Not the case here! I leave satisfied. And sweaty. If you don\'t like to sweat, maybe not the place for you. \n\nThe atmosphere is welcoming. There\'s no awkwardness about laughing in class.  Actually, the instructors are often the jokers! \n\nI\'ve made friends and business connections since I started going because its easy to bond there. \n\nI recommend this studio to everyone and anyone-- whether they are ""into"" yoga or not because typically people are surprised by the way they do things at Session.\n\nThere\'s a surprising male presence there too-- probably because there are power yoga classes that are great for strength building. \n\nI wholeheartedly say give this studio a go.', 'Session yoga coins itself as ""the power yoga for the people."" And I agree! For starters, you\'ll get greeted at the door with a big smile. The studio is super cozy yet bright. This studio is known for their heated power vinyasa flow classes that are heated (anywhere between 85-90 degrees). I\'m a beginner, so I opted for the Yoga Basics class. It\'s 75 minutes long and very approachable\nBeginners. It\'s is listed as a ""no heat"" class, but it was in fact heated, to my surprise. Angela, led the class with great energy. I\'ll definitely be back to this studio, although I\'d love to see more beginner classes on the schedule, as they offer only one at 8am on Sunday\'s.  Classes are $7 cash or $8 online. I suggest paying online and avoiding the line at check in. Bring plenty of water and a towel!', ""This is BY FAR my favorite yoga spot in Tucson.  And the closest to what I'm used to back home in Texas.\n\nThe staff is super friendly and patient with everyone who comes in.  Compared to what I'm used to, a drop in $7 yoga class is not bad at all!  (But I can see this being a draw back for college students as other places can be $4 or $5 for a drop in).  \n\nBut it's not just any yoga class, it's truly Power Vinyasa Flow. Other places don't come close to the real thing as this one does. \n\nI love the style of instruction (particularly Jessie):\n1. This is the type of Vinyasa flow that I love - full of cardio, core work, toning of muscles, and balancing - it's a 100% workout.  And you're left drenched in sweat.  The transitions are smoothly done and fully connected from pose to pose where there's no break in your practice. (other places talk too much about each pose and it becomes distracting and makes your yoga practice jerky or without connection)\n2. You're given freedom to do arm balances/head stands and variations other than what is being led during the practice (other places want you to stick to their poses).\n3. Inspiring, modern music  that helps drive the energy of the yoga practice.  Perhaps because music speaks to me in all aspects of my life, and especially with yoga.\n4. The way that the yoga practice led is in a very calming, relaxing, but empowering manner.  Other places lead the practice in a manner that can stress you out (again, by the talking too much), and that should never happen in your yoga practice!\n5.  The BEST part is the instructors may actually come around and MASSAGE you (especially why I love Jessie)!  As Thai massage is part of the yoga practice, this place practices that!!! It's the ONLY yoga studio I've found in Tucson where this is done.  It's an invaluable gift that these instructors give to you. And I don't understand why other places don't do this too!!! \n\nI would advise to come 15 minutes early if you can for the afternoon classes and even some of the morning classes, as the room fills up quickly! The studio itself is beautiful and calming with nice wooden floors and large windows to let the sunlight in. I do wish the room were bigger so there were more space between mats, but hey, it's a sign that of a good place when classes get that packed!\n\nNamaste. :)""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,30.0

That\'s us.  Hubby and me.  So a drive through burger kiosk in a strip mall parking lot is a highly unlikely place to find us given we have long been of the ""know what is in your food and where it comes from"" types.  To make it even more unlikely that we\'d end up placing our order at a kiosk with ""Burger"" in the name, I share the ""he"" of we won\'t eat beef in any form and the ""she"" won\'t eat it ground - unless ""she"" sees it ground in a butcher shop from a range raised cattle cut of her choice. \n\nBut here ""we"" ended up at a drive up burger kiosk after reading about the owner, Shad Cupp, who range raises the Scottish Highland cattle at his BVR Highland ranch and who started the ranching enterprise after having an epiphany about the flaws in our food supply when he saw ""Food, Inc."" and was then wrestling with his own health problems being compounded by a fast food diet.\n\nLearning he also had pork products from his pasture raised hogs, this kiosk was a destination dining choice even though we knew the only place to eat would be at picnic tables in the parking lot given we didn\'t think our ""little piggy"" brats would hold up all the way home.\n\nTHE EATS:  Eat the brats we did at that picnic table, every single bite - the ""he"" in a spicy Italian rendition (he is Sicilian after all) and the ""she"" in the classic with mustard and kraut - and licked our fingers clean of the yummy black pepper rich salt on the french fries too.  Another unlikely sighting for us given except for the true pommes frittes at Bacquet\'s in Eagle or Petite 4 on the Bench we don\'t eat french fries either.  And given both ""he""\' and ""she"" are lighter eaters with a lifetime of weight control challenges in the mix it is also unlikely to see us eat an entire dish of anything - sharing being usual MO - but a whole brat each was consumed with gusto.    Fresh made sausages using BVR ranch raised pork are served on local baker Gaston\'s buns and with local MFT ketchup for the fries and all at only about $10 each.  (The price includes a large soft drink, but on those we passed.) \n\nTHE OWNER:  Maybe it was seeing us lick our fingers that made the nice guy who owns this come out to ask us how we enjoyed the food.  It gave us a chance to talk about our shared perspectives on the importance of humane and sustainable practices in animal husbandry and learn more about his business.  With his adult son, Hoss, now largely running the ranch Shad has the time to run the kiosk and associated food truck.  He\'d like to be able to expand for other kiosk locations in the area so that people don\'t have to eat bad food to eat convenient food.  And while his animals are currently dispatched and processed at the only USDA approved facility in the area, he would one day like to have his own on ranch facility to do that to have end-to-end control of his product.  (If he does that, I\'m on board for one of those burgers too!)  He realizes a kiosk isn\'t ideal - no seating or loo for customers and all - but it was the affordable place to start.\n\nTHE DRILL:  Drive up to the window and a nice young \'un (on our day a delightful young woman who we assumed was a relation) will take your order.  Then if there is a car behind you, the same young \'un will go to that car to take theirs so the delay is minimal for waiting for food to be cooked (on our day Shad was doing the cooking).  But this is cooked to order eats, not McDonald\'s drive through, so set expectations for a little time being needed.  If you\'re planning on eating at the picnic tables, they\'ll offer to bring the food to you or you can walk up to the window to fetch your own (our choice) when it is ready. \n\nTHE SCENE*: Sure, you know it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErRHJlE4PGI\n\nPS:  God bless small ranchers and farmers who use sustainable agricultural models to provide good and healthy things for people to eat.', ""While I never associated the Scottish with fantastic burgers (if anything, I think fish and chips, meat pies, etc.), the Ranch - Scottish Highland Burgers definitely offers some great burgers and if you find yourself in Boise, Idaho, you do owe it to yourself to stop in and grab one of their fantastic burgers.\n\nNow I do think of potatoes when I think of Idaho and the french fries here are definitely something that this place has every right to brag about. They were cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside and pillowy tenderness underneath that crunchy exterior.\n\nFor the burger, I went with the Spicy Cowgirl, which was a quarter pound of grass fed, locally-raised beef topped with smoked gouda, jalapeno peppers, and mayo. Got some ketchup on it, too, because a burger needs ketchup. It comes with a drink and those tasty french fries, as well.\n\nPrices are good and the service was friendly. If you are extra hungry you can get an extra hamburger patty. I will forewarned you though that this place is little more than a shack with a drive-through. Don't expect some rustic-looking lodge type grandeur to enjoy your burger and fries and since they associated with Scotland, with bagpipe players serenading you. No, the only serenading might come from the traffic passing by on Overland Road and the ambiance that she will feel is the front seat of your car as you eat a quick lunch. But that does not take away from the quality of these great burgers and french fries.\n\nAll in all, I definitely recommend this establishment. Stop in and get a burger and some french fries. If you want to hear that bagpipe music, turn on the radio and look for a Scottish station or Google bagpipe music on your phone. But these burgers are pretty amazing."", 'This little shack is easy to miss but if you know, you know! They have amazing local grass fed burgers and brats. It\'s the best quality ""dad burger"" you can get in Boise. When you get a burger from here it\'s like you\'re at a backyard BBQ with a grill master dad who bought a locally raised grass fed cow. (Buying a cow, or portion of a cow is such an Idaho thing and once again, if you know you know). \nThis is probably the best quality meat you can get in a burger. If you take your meat and burgers seriously, you\'ve got to try this place out. \nThe fries are just as great and local as the burgers. Hand cut Idaho potatoes, fried up when you order and the seasoning on them is amazing! \nI didn\'t even get to try the fry sauce because my partner used it all up before I could get to them!

Our favorite item so far has surprisingly been the item we had the least expectation on, the Seafood Quesadilla. It is absolutely stuffed to the brim with crabmeat, shrimp, and crawfish tails, plus just a little cheese to keep it all together. What a pop of flavor. Definitely a must order.\n\nLooking at getting oysters? Belly up to the oyster bar located across the aisle and you'll see your oysters shucked right in front of you, plus with some added humor from those working (get ready for the dance moves and puns, like mothaShucka). Just remember you do still have to order at the counter. These oysters are larger in size than area restaurants we've stopped at before and are definitely fresh and delicious.\n\nWhy not five stars?

I feel people either love it or hate it. One of the things people don't like is eating with their hands, which I happen to think is super fun, especially with a group. (I know my kids will get a kick out of this!).\n\nThe thing I have to agree with as a negative is it can be a tad stuffy and a bit humid upstairs, but so can Morocco. To me it only makes it more of a true experience. Dress in layers here! \n\nReasons why I love it: \n-It's so cheap!! $25 a person! For 7 courses I believe! \n\n-It's a blast with a large party!! \n\n-They cater well to dietary restrictions. There is an option for plant-based folks and it's freaking delicious! \n\n-It's BYO!

YUM!!! \n\nThe meat options include lamb, chicken and beef kabobs, if I'm not mistaken. \n\nI feel everyone in Philly should at least try a dinner here once. It's more than a meal, it's an experience! And to top it off, there's belly dancing on the weekends!! \n\nIt's an incredibly good time! Make reservations though, it's on the small side. \n\nParking nearby isn't the easiest. If you're a city dweller, Uber will be your friend."", ""I've come here several times over the years, and I've always had a good time with friends and family.  Eating with your hands and having great conversation in an intimate setting of a dimly lit room with fabric all over the place is just cool.\n\nThe food has been consistently good and it is the same choices and courses over time.  The vegetable platter of eggplant, cucumbers/tomatoes, and carrots has to be my absolute favorite.  The pastry filled with chicken is savory and sweet with the powdered sugar on top.  Watch your fingers for the temperature burn!  The chicken is better than a rotisserie chicken, and you can get spicy or not.  They will bring the spice on the side for you if desired, and it's nice to dip if you like the spice!  Then, lamb  (meat on a plate with honey and almonds) or beef kebabs, or you can get a 1/2 and 1/2 if you want.  We did, and the lamb is always tender and the beef kebab filling.  Couscous with fresh fruit is kind of bland, and then there is hot mint tea which is a nice sugar rush, and baklava which I always skip because I'm usually too full, and I'm just not a fan of it.\n\nMarrakesh is a BYOB, and we have actually brought and killed multiple bottles of Moroccan wine - Ouled Thaleb ($17 at the State Stores) which is a blended red which goes well throughout the meal.  No corkage charges and they'll get rid of your empty bottles!  I think our group of eight killed at least eight bottles.\n\nAbout every 45 minutes, when the music gets turned up and pretty much too loud, you get to be dazzled by the belly dancer making her way throughout the restaurant.  You know she's getting close when the ting-ting-ting of her finger cymbals are getting loud.  Maybe you'll get to dance with her, or convince your drunk friend to.  It's amusing to watch.  \n\nMarrakesh's service is mostly spot-on as they have been doing this for a long time.  But, sometimes it can be slow.  The pita bread can be cold and a bit stale.  It is also cash only.\n\nParking can be a PITA, but our group last time had a lot of fun getting back to the car walking on South Street and remembering old days.\n\nHighly recommended."", ""Marrakesh is a total package dining experience. Not only do you get to eat authentic Moroccan cuisine, you get to enjoy a cultural experience as well. \n\nYou may have walked past Marrakesh or the surrounding streets many times without even realizing it was there, like I had prior to this visit. It's nestled on Leithgow Street just a notch off of South Street. Forget South Street or even the rest of Philadelphia for that matter. You are about to step into a different world. To enter you must ring the doorbell on the side door. \n\nI felt more like I was going to a house, than a restaurant; especially with the shower located in the restroom on the second floor. During my entire visit, I never felt like I was at a restaurant. I felt comfortable and relaxed. Maybe eating with your hands with a towel on your lap has that effect. \n\nI found my group of fellow Yelpers in a cozy private room.  The room had four tables with booth seating along the outskirts of the room. Ottoman like chairs took up the rest of the space for the rest of us. With such a large group in not the largest of spaces, it got loud.\n\nOur meal started with customary hand-washing and we were even entertained twice with a belly dancer. After placing our order, the food kept flowing. The service was probably the most unobtrusive service I've ever had. As one dish was placed in front of us, another was seamlessly removed. I felt like royalty or at least someone enjoying a nice meal at someone's dinner party. The regular dining formalities I'm used to were thrown out the window, and it was fantastic! \n\nAs I'm sure you're aware, this $25 prix fixe menu has seven courses and you are welcome to BYOB. While it was a ton of food, I walked in the door absolutely starving and walked out not overly stuffed. I believe most people left absolutely full, so maybe the tip is to come in extremely hungry. Here's a little rundown of dining experience:\n\nCourse 1: Three-Salad Platter- The eggplant is phenomenal (and messy). Luckily you have some assistance from the pita to eat it. The cucumbers and bell peppers and carrots and cucumber were good, but the eggplant stole the show. \n\nCourse 2: The B'stella- As someone who doesn't normally love sweets but loves cinnamon, carbs and meat, this dish was a winner. This dish was dough filled with chicken, nuts, almonds, egg, peppers and onions. It was really hot at first, but once you cracked open the shell and let it cool down, it was easier to eat. I had some pita saved from the first course, so I found it easy to break off a piece and rest it on the pita while it cooled down. Truly a sweet-savory delight. \n\nCourse 3: Chicken- So here's where the choices began. You can either get chicken with lemon or spicy chicken. My group opted to get the spicy chicken with the cumin sauce on the side. The chicken was melt in your hands and then melt in your mouth good. The spicy sauce had a nice kick without being overly spicy to me. I still had some pita leftover so I did a little dipping with the sauce. \n\nCourse 4: Beef or Lamb- My table got a little creative here and asked for half portions of both the beef and lamb. The beef was served shish kebab style, and to be honest, not my favorite. It was a little well done, and I struggled a little to get it off the stick resulting in a pepper flying into my husband's wine glass. Sauvignon blanc tastes best with a little pepper anyways, right? The lamb was perfect. Even the non-lamb eaters thought it was delicious. It was tender and took on the flavor of the chick peas and onions without having an overwhelming lamb flavor. \n\nCourse 5: Couscous with veggies, chick peas and raisins- This was probably my least favorite dish from the main meal. It was a little blander than other couscous dishes I've tried in the past. I would have been disappointed if this was the only thing I ordered, but everything was a hit thus far in the evening. They did give us spoons at this point, so don't worry about eating the little grains with your hands.\n\nCourses 6 & 7: Dessert- I'm assuming the tea, fruit and pastries count as the sixth and seventh courses. At this point in the evening, my bottle of wine had been consumed and I wasn't counting the dishes, and am making this assumption while referencing the menu. I'm not a tea fan so I passed. The pastries were little crisp triangles that reminded me of baklava. The fruit came out frozen was a little hard to eat. I nibbled on a strawberry and took a banana for the road since the majority of the group passed on the fruit. Perhaps the fruit was customary, but I thought a little unnecessary. If it's part of the traditional meal then no harm, no foul.  \n\nTo sum it up, I had delicious food and hours of fun.

Unbeknownst to us, it was a fraternities weekend reunion, a cocktail conference, and two other citywide events as well.  This place had good reviews, so we took the plunge.  Located very close to everything, we couldn't have done better if we tried.  3/4 of our outings were walkable from the hotel.  The room has a classy feel to it.  You could see some spots that needed touch ups, post-renovation. It's an older facility, so you expect some wear and tear.  The AC was on point during this hot summer weekend.  The staff were fantastic from curbside, to room service, to the bar tender.  Everyone was very nice and helpful.  The pool was nice, i went at 8 am both mornings.  The second day there was a fair amount of trash around the pool.  This could have been cleaned prior to pool opening.  There a was also what looked to be a broken window on a door next to the pool the next day.  NOLA is always a party.  Can't help what the hooligans do.  There was no glass or anything, so kudos for the clean up. \n\nSome areas for improvement:\n- Cosmetic touch ups.  The ac vent needed some caulking and paint.  Gaps look worse than they actually are.\n- The hot water took 15 minutes to arrive.  I don't mind a cold shower, but my roommate was less than happy about it.\n- The door required sufficient strength to open.  It and the frame were not seeing eye to eye.  Older, younger, and weaker folks would have issues getting in and out.  \n-Spot check the pool area for cleaning.  Kids dont need to be tripping on bottles and whatnot.  Nor do i ;)\n\nDefinitely a food spot I would hit up again for a weekend excursion."", 'I had Hotel Provincial pinned in my Pinterest Board as a place to see in Louisiana because I read about this hotel in a magazine article. Don\'t ask me where, I don\'t keep track of that.\n\nThe only photo I had of it was its beautiful courtyard with the fountain in the center surrounded by wrought iron furniture. I was intrigued...\n\nListed on the National Register of Historic Places? Hook...\n\nLocally owned? Line....\n\nConveniently located in the French Quarter? Sinker!!!\n\nThough this hotel is located in the French Quarter, it\'s on a quiet street away from Bourbon Street almost across the street from the Old Ursuline Convent. It is also, if you are so inclined, only three short blocks to Café Du Monde which is open 24 hours a day.\n \nThe porters always greet you warmly and though the lobby is not grand, it sure has its own old world charm and elegance.\n\nWe were assigned a room on the ground floor off of the courtyard the photo of which brought this hotel to my attention in the first place. I loved it. In the morning, I would just open  my door so that I get a good view of this courtyard. You can open the window too and then you\'ll really feel like the entire courtyard is part of your room.\n\nIf you\'re an early sleeper, this might not be the best location. I keep thinking I\'m still young, but I am always disabused of this notion whenever I want to go to sleep and YOUNGER adults are still up partying.\n\nOur room was pretty large with a very large vanity and a separate ""room"" for the sink, closet, and separate bathroom.\n\nComplimentary WiFi is essential when you are trying to face time the kids. Also for instagramming all those awesome photos you\'ve been taking during the day.', 'It\'s a beautiful historic hotel with multiple buildings and a lovely courtyard. It\'s also HAUNTED. I wish I had looked into this before I booked it but honestly I would have laughed off any stories (as I did when I stayed on the Queen Mary with no incident). \n\nNow, I know what you\'re thinking and you\'re wrong. I am not crazy. I am a productive member of society with no drug problem or mental issues to speak of.\n\nSo it went like this... \n\nThis hotel was recommended to me as the perfect place to stay near the Quarter but not in the middle of the drunken debauchery..\n\nI booked a poolside suite for 2 nights on Expedia at a great rate. We ended up arriving one night earlier than planned and our suite was occupied, so we were given a room in Building 5 and told we could move into our suite the following day. \n\nIt was late and we were starving, so we found Tableau and they fed us even after closing time (I owe them a review). The only alcohol I had with my dinner was a Bellini, which I only had a few sips of anyway \n\nWe returned to the room, cranked up the a/c and went to bed. At approximately 3am I woke up to my bed shaking (2 queen beds in the room, I was in one by myself). Next to the bed stood a man in red whose face and very detailed story I will never forget. He told me his name and began to share stories of his life and his demise. He died in that very building alone and in great pain. I tried to close my eyes and wish it away but when I did my bed would shake again and he begged me to listen. I will spare you the long and heartbreaking story.\n\nFinally after a couple of hours I was able to sleep again...ok I jumped in my son\'s bed and put the covers over my head. \n\nIn the morning my son asked why I wasn\'t in my bed. I didn\'t want to tell him so I said there was a draft. \n\nAs we were getting ready to head out for breakfast, he asked me what was wrong and I just started babbling about the whole thing and to my surprise started crying hysterically. \n\nCrying is NOT something I do easily. He looked at me like I was nuts. He said it had to be a dream. I wish it was. \n\nWe walked down to the front desk so I could ask about getting our luggage moved to the suite. \n\n""Good news"" the front desk clerk chirped with a smile ""if you\'d prefer to stay in your current room for the next two days you\'re welcome to...""\n\n""NO!"" I shot back defensively, then in a less harsh tone I asked to be moved as soon as possible.\n\nWhen we returned later that day we retrieved our keys and our luggage was in the new room. No further incidents. Loved the suite by the pool. \n\nThe restaurant was closed the week we were there but there was always coffee at the bar in the morning. \n\nThe concierge (a sweet and friendly older lady) helped us with useful information and booking activities. \n\nWhen we checked out she asked about our stay, so I hinted about my experience in building 5 but she didn\'t press so I didn\'t explain. I just wanted to know if I was the only one.   \n      \nI would definitely recommend this hotel, but only buildings 1-4.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,30.0

After a week of nonstop feasting on my recent NOLA trip, I would rate my dinner here as solid, but forgettable.\n\nI probably had higher expectations from all the accolades, and I wasn't blown away, but I did enjoy my meal.\n\nComplimentary Biscuits - Served with honey butter and bacon butter. The butters were delicious, though I couldn't taste much bacon. The biscuit itself wasn't flaky enough and was slightly underdone.\n\nCaribbean Seafood Pepper Pot - Very small portion, but large in flavor. Wish I had some bread to soak up that broth!\n\nSpiced Pig Ears - A great app for sharing. Heavily seasoned, fried crunchy goodness. Served with smoked aioli.\n\nHamachi - This was the first time I had raw fish with guava and papaya, and I loved this combo!\n\nTrio of Pork - My favorite main dish. That pork belly was so good - fatty, yet bright.\n\nJerk Black Drum - The fish was a tad overcooked. I'm obsessed with sunchokes, so I loved that part.\n\nRoasted Half Chicken - Juicy, flavorful chicken served over rice. Loved the cilantro.\n\nSemolina Gnocchi, Collard Greens - The gnocchi was too gummy in texture, though I liked the addition of collard greens and the general creamy comfort feel. \n\nRoasted Banana Zeppole - These were like banana beignets. Crunchy shell and delightful with a side of rum caramel sauce.\n\nSoursop Semifreddo - A unique and more savory dessert. The celery and cucumber added an interesting green note. It tasted very healthy, but being a green smoothie type of person, I found myself liking this.\n\nService was pleasant though could be more attentive, timing was a long between apps and mains, and drinks took a while.\n\nAnd that's all I have to say. TBH, my review is pretty forgettable."", 'Very happy to have had the opportunity to try out Compere Lapin with a group since I was able to try a handful of appetizers as well as their delicious entrees. \n\nThe space is pretty large compared to new restaurants, but still feels intimate at your table. I can see that they\'ve incorporated some sound proofing elements since their opening and it helps to be able to hear the folks at your table. I love that James Michalopoulos\' work adorns the walls, and it\'s mostly some of his lesser known work including landscapes that he did while vacationing in France. It all fits very well in the space. \n\nWe were seated at a wide table making it easier for us all to share/see one another\'s dishes and great lighting (how\'d they know we were going to be those pic-snapping guests? ;) ). \n\nThe menu is broken down by Small Bites, First, Second, and Extras. I love that this restaurant doesn\'t cater to the traveler\'s need for ""authentic New Orleans cuisine"". It genuinely feels like 100% what the Chef wants on the menu. I also love that it\'s pseudo-Caribbean without succumbing to the tiki theme. Everything I ordered or enjoyed a bite of was wonderful.  \n\nDishes - \nCold Smoked Tuna Tartare/Avocado/Crispy Bananas $14\n\nGreat starter dish. Light and fresh with no fishy smells. You can appreciate the tuna\'s natural flavors without being overpowered by seasoning or lime juice. If you need texture, the banana chips add a great crunch. Be selfish and order this one for yourself if you really enjoy tuna. \n\nBrussels Sprouts/Buttermilk/Crispy Chicken Skin $13\n\nI really have to stop saying I hate Brussels sprouts. I\'ve managed to enjoy Brussels sprouts at a few places around town including 1000 Figs and Brown Butter. The sprouts at Compere Lapin may take the cake. I think the winning factor is the crispness. Nothing mushy or sour about these morsels of heavenly goodness, and again...maybe just order these for yourself if you\'re feeling exceptionally greedy. \n\nCaribbean Seafood Pepper Pot $21\n\nI ordered this as my entree. This dish falls under the First section so it\'s not going to be as large as a dish in the Second section but I wouldn\'t have had my entree any other way. First off, the dish is beautiful. After a short photo shoot of bright greens from the fresh dill and basil, hues of pink from various seafood and the watermelon radish, and the orange of the broth that bathed all this deliciousness, I dove in. I really can\'t tell you what spices were mixed into the broth, nor can I identify every type of seafood in this pot of heaven. It wasn\'t overly spicy and the broth didn\'t cloak the flavors of the seafood.\n\nMy best way to describe this dish is that it transported me to an open air restaurant atop an island overlooking the ocean watching the sunset with a cool breeze passing through. \n\nDuo of Beef/Cauliflower/Foie Gras $32\n\nWhile I was experiencing nirvana with the Pepper Pot, I did do a bite barter with my neighbor who was enjoying the duo of beef. He was kind enough to let me enjoy both meat options that were perfectly cooked, melt-in-your-mouth delicious. \n\nI will absolutely be back, and will venture into the Second menu section for a taste of this Curried Goat that is wildly popular in other reviews.', ""Awesome new restaurant!\n\nMy next-door neighbors (hi Chad and Mary!) both work at CL -- one as soux chef and one as a server -- so I had heard about this place before it even opened.

I also really enjoyed the black-eyed peas and goat. But you really can't go wrong here. Everything on the menu is full of flavor and perfectly prepared.\n\nChad and Mary took good care of us and the rest of the service was very nice too.

As I have mentioned in prior reviews, I have a myriad of food allergies, most of which are at issue in Louisiana cooking: peppers, chilis, potatoes, and tomatoes. As a result, I could not order any hollandaise options off the menu because it is made with hot sauce but she walked me through the menu to show me what I could eat.

Many others had the same thought so it was pretty packed with convention-goers but the young ladies working here did a great job accommodating the influx of people. One of the owners even stopped by our table to see how everything tasted and to see how our experience was. She said she makes all the crab cakes every morning as well as many of the other menu items. \n\nThe flavors were excellent! You must get the grits as they are very smooth, creamy and tender. The ultimate Southern comfort food. We shared the Crab Cake Benedict and the BBQ Shrimp & Grits. The Crab Cake Benedict boasts flaky well-seasoned crab meat dressed with their luscious Cajun hollandaise. What a treat! \n\nI also tried one of their fresh green juices, the Green Blast (kale, spinach, carrot, lime, ginger and apple), to power me through the afternoon training sessions. It was very quenching and fortifying. \n\nTwo Chicks is a fun colorful cafe spawned by two friends that have a passion for food and New Orleans.

I love Fair Grinds, yet I apparently never wrote them a review. So here\'s the five star review they\'ve been missing for almost 2 years now. \n\nFirst a mention on how they are one of the only coffeehouses in NOLA that\'s dedicated to fair trade coffees and all of their tea is organic. That the tea is organic is a huge deal as I recently learned non-organic teas are ridden with pesticides. Not that I\'m such a big tea drinker, but in September-October I\'m all about dirty chai and by ""dirty"" that means a shot of espresso, not a spray of pesticides! Thankfully they make their own chai and hooray for it not being overly sweetened like that stuff from the box.  They have almond milk in addition to soy, so you don\'t have to worry about GMO-ridden lattes!\n\nI haven\'t tried their baked goods, all of which look delectable, but I had lunch once, some kind of vegetarian sandwich that I can\'t recall other than the fact that it was quite good. If you\'re in the mood for lunch, be aware that they stop serving it around 2. Bagels and pastries are available all the time, though!\n\nFair Grinds is small and cozy and a traditional coffeehouse in that it\'s more reminiscent of being in a real house than a sterile storefront/corporate coffee bar. They have community-based activities like Kundalini Yoga weekly and various performances. The staff is so very kind and accommodating and I just love that side verdant patio that\'s off to the side. It\'s the kind of place I can easily lose hours in good conversation or a book. But typically I\'m working on my laptop, so to that end, you don\'t have to go crazy scoping out an outlet. Internet works just fine every time I\'ve been there. \n\nI have some great coffeehouses in my area, but none of them ""have it all"" like Fair Grinds. The fact that I actually get in my car and drive the 15 minutes or so that it takes to get here speaks volumes, doesn\'t it?', 'I was wandering along Esplanade when I realized I was in dire need of hydration so I stopped in for a well-brewed and inexpensive iced tea. \n\nThe outdoor space is wonderful and the indoor seating looked very comfy. On this gorgeous Saturday afternoon the space was pretty full but seating could still be had. \n\nThe barista was friendly and looked grateful that I just wanted a simple iced tea. If I lived closer I would definitely be a regular.', 'At first, I wasn\'t a huge fan of Fair Grinds, perhaps because it always seemed to be overly crowded, kind of noisy, and whatever coffee drink I ordered wasn\'t what I was looking for. My first impression, however, was way off. This is actually a pretty awesome little coffee shop. \n\nAfter finding myself compelled to come back for meetings and so forth, Fair Grinds started to grow on me. The day I discovered their citron green tea (it tastes like Pez!) is the day I decided this is one of my favorite local coffee shops. \n\nInside, they\'ve got large, colorful tables that are really close together and therefore somewhat difficult to navigate at times. There\'s also a courtyard/alleyway space for those of us who prefer to work outside. Conveniently, most of the tables even have outlets (if they\'re next to the building), so it\'s just as easy to waste time on Twitter/Facebook--ahem, ""work""--at an outside table as it to do this inside. In fact, it\'s sometimes easier to find a spot outside, because this place can definitely get crowded. \n\nThey\'re cash only, which of course is annoying, but the Pez tea (and free refills!) is good enough to make it worth acquiring beforehand. The staff is always friendly, though it does seem like I\'ve never seen the same barista twice. Perhaps that\'s just because I don\'t hang out here enough. \n\nIf you\'re looking for a change of pace from your regular coffee shop, go check out Fair Grinds. It\'s one of my favorite neighborhoods in New Orleans, and there\'s lots of stuff nearby. Swirl, Canseco\'s, Cafe Degas, Terranova\'s market, Lola\'s, some spa... Oh! And an awesome little park across the street.

I was very happy to find that the instructor took the time to show me all of the moves/punches before the class started (even though we ran into the class start time). Honestly, I needed that refresher and if you're a first timer this will put you at ease!\n\nI loved the intervals, they were perfectly spaced so I wasn't doing the same thing for minutes on end. I also really liked how the intervals built on each other - definitely made it a challenging but fun memory game so your focus is not on how tired your might be, but rather what's next in the combination. I also like how they do body weight exercise intervals but it's not overkill. It's definitely the challenging stuff I avoid, like plank jacks, pushups, etc but they more than welcome modifications because at the end of the day it's your fitness journey.\n\nOnly qualm is that the space is pretty tiny - that said, I went to a class with 30+ people in and it didn't feel cramped! It's just weird when they tell you to run two laps and it's the size of a large living room, you know?

You soon find muscles in all the right places, and during class your brain keeps telling you that you\'re not dying, so keep moving! Plus, the thought of going beast mode on a heavy punching bag does more for me than any workout that I\'ve tried. It really is my new obsession. You learn and burn! Learn new combos, and burn off a gazillion (ok, I\'m exaggerating, but it seems close to that number) calories at each class.  \n\nThe place has been open a little more than two months, and I\'ve been to enough classes where I\'ve experienced each instructor. All of them are OUTSTANDING and MOTIVATING, and each of them are different. Regardless, every hour you spend at CKO is worth it. I love that you go at your own pace and skill level, so don\'t feel that you need to kick higher or throw 10 more punches than the person next to you. You compete against yourself to do better, and at the end of class, you leave stronger and confident that the next one will be better than the last. You\'ll be planking longer, running faster, and throwing more powerful kicks and punches. \n\nFor those that are new, I highly recommend going to your first class 15-20 min early and coming with an open mind. You\'ll learn the basic punches and kicks with one of the instructors, and then you\'re all set to join the class for a fun workout! All the classes have the same format: warm up, lots of exercises on your core, work some combos on the bag, maybe 1-2 freestyle sessions, and then a cool down (you\'ll love the moment when they say starfish!). \n\nI love coming to my new ""therapy sessions"" because it relieves stress, and after a rough day at work, it\'s awesome to get angry and destroy the bag. \n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, I\'ll learn to love burpees.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,

I\'m just saying they know how to procure.  \n\nThey have an excellent variety of champagnes and sparkling wines, and keep a decent choice of them cold for your emergency celebrations.  And the brothers give the best recommendations for both wine and spirits. \n\nThey also sell imported cheeses, meats, and other Italian delicacies found on the shelves and in the coolers at the front of the store.  But when I asked if they sold caponata, one of the brothers looked at me in a sort of bewildered way, and said something like, ""What?  Caponata?  No, we make that at home.  We don\'t buy Caponata.  Do you buy Caponata anywhere?  No, you make it at home.""

He asked if we wanted samples of wine, but since we were there for that already, we just ordered a glass each. It was a red Argentinian wine. We sat at the one and only table situated in the front of the store with 4 chairs. Because it was lunch hour on a weekday, we sat there and had the pleasure of witnessing the daily lives of the locals here! Workers from the courthouse across the street, construction workers, retail store clerks, would come in with their bagged lunches or to-go lunches, greeted by Mr. Blaze, have a short chat, purchase a drink (wine, beer, water or sodas) and leave. Some would sit with us at the table eating their lunches and made small talk with us.  It was one of the most entertaining people watching event I've ever experienced.\n\nAs old as Mr. Blaze was, he had no hesitation climbing on stairs and stocking the shelves. His store also sells local spices, snacks and just lots and lots of beverage selections.

This restaurant is worthy of that title. ""Khyber Pass Pub"" was on a list of places to eat at in Philadelphia, so I made it my business to get here. From the outside it looks like a small bar, that if you walked to fast you may not even see it. But heading inside, judging by the loud music upstairs, I knew this is a very hip spot. It\'s low lit, with a comfortable vibe. It has two floors and a bar on each. Downstairs is the restaurant, where you can eat and socialize. Upstairs is where they have a live band, where you can dance the night away. But dancing would wait because I was hungry. When I got to the hostess stand, I was told to find a seat and I did. My waitress, Mikaela, came over and she was amazing. She was friendly and recommended all the best food. She joked about not knowing about them being on the best spot list. But after a short conversation I ordered the Mac & cheese to start. Those Mac balls were incredible! The were placed on a home made sauce that seemed to bring all the flavor out. I asked for a side of the sauce for my sweet potato fries it was so good. I told her I wanted the burger because it came highly recommend. That recommendation was on point. I didn\'t change anything about the burger, I got it according to the menu. I\'m so glad I did. The beef was sensational, the bacon crunchy, and the dry cheese complimented the entire burger. Topped off with the pretzel bun and sautéed onions, and you got the best burger in Philadelphia. I will make it my point to come again. Atmosphere, food, and service! Who can beat that?', ""My experience at Khyber wasn't a good one. I couldn't really figure out the vibe, and the service and food were both quite disappointing. \n\nI was with a party of six and we arrived at about 5pm for an early dinner. We were there on a Saturday so it was pretty crowded, as expected. During the approximate two hours that we spent there, the music kept fluctuating from soft to loud which definitely made an impact on the overall vibe. I felt like I was continuously changing my voice because I was either trying to yell over the music or trying not to scream into my neighbor's ear. \n\nMy table started with a few appetizers: Bbq pulled pork nachos, fried green tomatoes and wings. The nachos were alright. The portion is huge so it's a good choice for a group. I was really excited to try the tomatoes but I actually didn't like them at all. They were way too salty for me. I skipped out on the wings but a few people at the table enjoyed them. \n\nMy other half and I shared the fried shrimp po' boy for our entree. Another food item that I was really excited for only to be disappointed by. It didn't have much of a taste to it. I was underwhelmed. The sweet potato fries that I got as a side might have been the best part of the meal and even they weren't anything to rave about. \n\nAlthough our waitress was quick with serving us, she seemed so unpleased with our table and it definitely showed. \n\nKhyber has made a good name for itself so maybe I just happened to be there on a bad night but regardless, I'm in no hurry to return."", ""Excuse me, have you had the mac and cheese?

On Friday night I went in to get gel tips for my bridal shower the next weekend.  I do think it was my mistake to go in during their busiest time, but don't think that is necessarily an excuse for rushed work.  The manager Robert sat me down and started working.  I pulled my hands back and told him I needed to explain what I wanted.  He kept saying okay but continued to rush through.  I stopped him various times to point out things and he would say to wait until the end.  The more I tried to tell him what I wanted, the more he would dismiss me or walk away.  He answered his phone 3 times during my nails, which I could forgive if it weren't for what happened later.  When he was finished, before polish, I showed him a couple nails that were bumpy and misshaped.  He politely said he would fix them but at that point I had to leave.  He told me to come back when I could and he would fix them.  I tipped him $10, told him I appreciated him allowing me to come back and left.  \n\nWhen I went back a couple days later to get them fixed it was a weekday morning, which I figured there'd be plenty of time to communicate.  He was incredibly rude and told me there was nothing to fix.  I kept pointing to the nails that were messed up and he kept telling me there was nothing wrong, while rolling his eyes.  He angrily and roughly started taking off the polish saying he would do them the same way as before.  A girl named Alicia came up and started yelling at me, saying that I didn't know what I want and so I should just leave.  I started getting upset and Alicia (I think that is her name) went into the back and laughed telling the other girls that I was crying.  I told her I could hear her, and she started yelling back at me from the back of the salon, telling me to leave.  I was getting so upset that my nails were ruined for my shower in a couple days and told her that.  She laughed at me and said that I'll never know what I want, and then she told another girl that she can't stand girls like me.  Robert finally cut off all of the nails, my real nails too and told me to leave.  I left there still so upset and now with ruined nails that I will have to go somewhere else to get fixed and pay for again.  I would never wish this experience on anyone and still cannot believe it happened."", 'This place is a sad excuse for a ""salon and spa"", I came here to have acrylic tips put on and left less than satisfied. My tips nails were bumpy, different lengths, and all lifted within a week. The girl who did my nails spent her entire time talking to her coworkers or on her cell phone, which typically doesn\'t bother me, but when I tried tot tell her what I wanted, she wouldn\'t even stop to listen. When she painted them, they were streaky and uneven but as I was in a rush, I said it was fine and headed out the door. When I got home that night I took the polish off and filed and shaped them myself as best I could. \n\nTwo weeks later I decided to give them a second try just to see if the first experience was a fluke. I went in and there was a wait, so I sat down and flipped through some emails on my phone, a second girl came in after me and asked if there was a wait and they told her no, I politely told the man that I had been waiting to which he told me, ""You keep waiting"" as annoyed as I was, I decided to keep waiting. \n\nAfter 10 minutes, a woman finally took me to her chair, while she was working, another employee who does the facials there was walking around talking to everyone, she came up to me and started telling me about the services they offer for facials as I was getting my nails done, which was fine, until she started loudly talking about how awful my skin is and how I really need some sort of treatment because it looks ""infected"".

Poetic license for a largely underappreciated songwriter and rock performer, Warren Zevon. He spent a lot of time in the city, especially in the early 1980s, when he was living with, and ultimately married to a well know radio DJ here. They lived on Rittenhouse Square for several years, before divorce drove him back to California.  If you were very fortunate, you saw his concert at the TLA on South Street, and had your musical life changed.\n\n He really visited the small Cantonese restaurant on the corner of 11th and Spring Streets and used it for inspiration for the song, ""Werewolves of London."" Even the kitchen door in an alley off Spring Street, found its way into the lyrics, as the door you must not open unless you sought the fate of the, ""Little old lady, got mutilated late last night..."" It remains a scary place even today with decades of thick, black grease caked to the walls and pavement. Who knows what evil lurks in those sewer drains?! \n\nSo, I was there the other day after a haircut across the street. I had been singing his songs as I drove to Philly, and wanted to pay homage to the man and have some good Cantonese food. \n\nThe dining room was small, with no more than eight tables. It was well preserved in dark mahogany stained panels.  It was fairly clean and tidy for a joint in C.Town. We were the only customers on arrival, and took liberties to walk around a bit and take a few photos. Amazingly, not a thing memorializing Zevon. Maybe this third generation Asian kitchen doesn\'t know from American rock and roll. Warren would no doubt get a laugh out of that. \n\nWe ordered Salt Baked Squid, Orange Beef and Fish Hot Pot; more than enough for two of us, but plenty to bring home for the sons. They were all very good, if not best of breed. The squid was tender and mildly salty as expected.  The beef was plentiful with a good dark red amber sauce and sliced onion and green pepper. The fish arrived in a covered casserole still bubbling from the fire in the kitchen. Soft, moist and delicious. Each dish was $11.95. Credit cards accepted. \n\nThis was one of the better Cantonese meals eaten in C.Town, made more desirable by the ability to think about Warren Zevon sitting at the table in back, chowing down and noodling about a song that we are still singing long after his death. \n\nAaoooooooo!', ""Ordered some delivery this past Saturday because I had a taste for something healthy and hot- so ended up getting a egg noodle soup with chicken. \nWe also ordered crab Rangoon and Peking spare ribs. \n\nThis was my first time ordering from here but I am glad I did. \n\nI ordered from Door Dash and the food took about 35 minutes to arrive. When the food came it was fresh and hot. The egg noodle with chicken had ramen in it with bak choy. The broth tastes so flavorful and the chicken was cooked perfectly. \n\nI didn't try the Peking spare ribs but they looked good- they werent like usual spare ribs on the bone. They were breaded and covered in sauce. The crab Rangoon came in 5 pieces and were very fresh. They tasted really good."", 'What a disappointing experience (surprisingly) I had at Lee How Fook.

I took the train into town and arrived early to meet my friend for dinner only to get a message my friend couldn\'t make it in time for dinner and would meet me at the theatre.  Ok. I decided to just head up to Lee How Fook on 11th Street and grab a meal there.  I walked in about 5 o\'clock - no one else was inside except the staff making dumplings at a back table. They all just looked at me and didn\'t say a word. I said  ""Are you open?""  They said yes and I sat down at a corner table.  Finally someone got up and came to me and I ordered the salt-baked squid.  No tea ever came my way - that\'s a first for me in Chinatown....and it was a cold snowy day outside when tea would have been warming.  The salt-baked squid arrived promptly and it was decent - but by far not the best I have ever eaten.  Unfortunately one of the condiment bottles on the table was so sticky it was actually gross and the hot chili peppers needed a refill.  I exchanged them for the condiments on the empty table next to me.  When I asked for the bill I got it with not even a thank you expressed.  I paid and promptly left and headed into the storm to the theatre where my friend had arrived safely and the play was excellent.\n\nI don\'t think I will ever eat again in Lee How Fook.

From it's simple but lovely decor to the amazing food and service, I had no hesitation in giving Spice Finch a glowing five star review. \n\nI had a 7pm reservation on a Tuesday night for me and my friend who was visiting from Canada. She just recently moved out of Philly and when deciding where to go for dinner, her only request was for me to choose a place that was new for both of us. Spice Finch had been on my mind for a few months now so I figured this would be perfect for the occasion.\n\nOur sweet waitress gave us a rundown of the menu and told us that dishes are typically made for sharing. With that in mind, we both ordered fries to share but decided to choose our own entrees. I'm allergic to both chickpeas and lentils so unfortunately, I have quite a few food restrictions at Mediterranean restaurants. I shared this with the waitress when I ordered the peri-peri shrimp and she assured me that she would speak to the chef to make sure these ingredients were not used in this dish and there was no cross contamination. Thank you to the team at Spice Finch for making me feel so well taken care of!\n\nThe peri-peri shrimp was incredible. So flavorful and rich with well-cooked, plump shrimp. I became a huge fan of peri peri during my trip to South Africa last year and am so happy I got to enjoy it here. The dish came with a side of buttery flatbread that I dipped into the sauce. \n\nThe fries that my friend and I shared were also very good. They were well-seasoned and the portion was huge. I couldn't have the hummus aioli they come with but my friend said it was delicious. Although the sauce looked great, I was more than content just enjoying the fries sans dip!\n\nFor dessert we enjoyed a slice of chocolate cake with tahini soufflé and blood orange sorbet. I was a little skeptical because I'm not usually a fan of fruity desserts but wow was this dish really something! The blood orange sorbet really balanced out the rich chocolate cake, but in my opinion, the tahini soufflé was the MVP. I could have eaten spoonfuls of that alone!\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful. It is open and airy with the appropriate lighting. It isn't too bright but not too dark either. Lighting can make such a big difference - it really sets the mood and Spice Finch does it just right. This restaurant is great for get-togethers, celebrations or dates. \n\nI can't wait to return here. I'm tempted to make my next experience a brunch outing, but with such an incredible dinner, it'll be hard not to go back for that!"", ""I really wish I hadn't waited to write this review as the details aren't as fresh in my memory. But, I'd be remiss if I didn't still pop up to give my five star seal of approval! \n\nMy husband and I had reservations for an early dinner on a Saturday in October. We tried a lot from the menu: date truffles, garlic yogurt, baked cheese, croquettes, chili chicken kebab, and whole roasted fish. Honestly, I think there was more but, like I said, it's a little hazy over a month later. All I know for sure is that our table was covered with gorgeous food! \n\nEvery dish packed a ton of flavor but there was a lot of variety between each plate. Extra props for the fish, which was sea bass on our visit. If you know anything about Jen Carroll, it's that she knows her way around a fish-you'd be kind of silly not to order one at her restaurant! The sea bass was absolutely perfect.  \n\nI was partaking in a sober October, and was thrilled to try the N/A Groni, which I had read about prior to our dinner. Basically, it's a booze-free take on a negroni. I absolutely love bitter cocktails and this version was delicious and made me feel really excited to sip on something interesting. \n\nUnfortunately, we had to rush through our desserts as we were running behind for another commitment. Our own fault as we really took our time during dinner. I won't make that mistake again; next time, Spice Finch is the main event! Looking forward to trying the breakfast and brunch menus as well."", ""I honestly wasn't expecting much from Spice Finch, but last night's dinner blew me away! The restaurant is located inside the Warwick Hotel and is huge. It can accommodate a lot of people but I would still recommend making reservations.\n\nMy husband and I decided to go with the Chef's Tasting Menu since it sounded like a good deal, and it really was.\n\nThe Chef started us out with the trio of spreads, which included the garlic yogurt, green hummus, baba ganoush, berbere crisps, and vegetable crudites. The vegetable crudite were thinly sliced beets, radish and cucumbers. Perfect for scooping any of the spreads, and very refreshing to snack on.\n\nThen came the broccoli tabbouleh and a small plate of baked cheese(?) They were two little bite sized pieces and very fluffy to eat, like eating a Japanese tamago. So delicious, I wish I could have some more. The broccoli tabbouleh was good too, but the portions were huge so make sure you pace yourself.\n\nNext came the blistered peppers and asparagus, both of which I am in love with. The asparagus was hearty and meaty in the most meatless sense. The feta and morele mushrooms rounded out the green chile so well. The vegetables here are so nicely done. I just can't stop eating this food!\n\nWith exception of the main dish, the Chef decides what to serve the table, and so far we were enjoying what he/she was sending out. The next course was the kebab course, and we were served the shrimp kebab, which was not what we would have chosen but it was perfectly cooked. The shrimp (4) were big and soft, and the roasted garlic & peppers under the kebab were nice too.\n\nAfter a long while, our main dish - the lamb shank arrived, and it was glorious. The meat felt right off the bone, and it tasted and smelled even better than I imagined it would. The warm grain salad that came with the lamb shank seemed unnecessary and was ok.\n\nDinner was concluded with a warm tahini brownie and (2) bite size date truffles. The brownie was standard. The date truffles on the other hand were gross. I wish they let you choose your dessert!\n\nOverall, we enjoyed Spice Finch. The food was great and the staff were really nice, but service was disorganized. Our dinner lasted two hours. There were long stretches of time where food was not being served, and we were barely checked on. It was clearly a busy night, but I hope it will be better the next time we come back.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,50.0

Give yourself plenty of time if you plan on coming here as dnnertime can be an expected hour wait easily.  My suggestion would be to put your name in and find a nearby bar to grab a drink and wait.  \n\nThey don't have many different types of burgers here so if you want one of those pizza burgers or BBQ rodeo burger things, you won't find it here.  Now, they do have other items on the menu, but you'll only cheat yourself if you don't have the burger.  I got their regular Village Burger.  They do have some options for toppings you can add-- I went with the Haystack Mountain Chevre cheese which is a goat cheese.  I've gotten it twice and is the best cheese I've ever had on a burger.  I also got a fried egg on it and one thing I've learned about egg on a burger is it can make a good one great and a great one amazing.  As for the rest of it, the bun is a good choice; it doesn't break apart and goes perfectly with the juicy burger.  As if the burger isn't good enough, the fries might even be better.  They're made with duck fat, which might as well be tears of an angel.  The fries are seasoned, thicker cut, and left with some skin on and that all amounts to great fries.  \n\nFor as much as I love trying new places in the city, this is on the short list of places to keep coming back to."", ""The Whiskey Burger.\n\nThe Whiskey Burger.\n\nI repeat, The Whiskey Burger.\n\nThe guys were raving about this place but I did not feel like walking 15mins from our hotel to go try this burger, but I'm glad I did because I would've walked a thousand miles (Vanessa Carlton voice) to taste this burger.

To me this is the  perfect place in which to rest your weary food and drink addled body following your days and evenings spent gadding about town.\n\n It\'s an easy walk to the French Quarter and environs taking 15 minutes or so (not sure what the griping is about in other reviews about this) .  \n\nBeing in this location means you don\'t have to be in the heart of all the noise and sometimes craziness of the French Quarter when you\'re trying to rest up.\n\nThe hotel is in an aesthetically pleasing red brick 4 story building that was once a  warehouse.  It has been beautifully and conscientiously renovated.   As soon as you enter the hotel you\'re  immediately greeted by a lovely lobby with gorgeous art work surrounding you from all angles. \n\nWhat drew me to this hotel intially was seeing photos on-line of the Dale Chihuly blown-glass chandeliers.  I love Dale Chihuly and had recently gone to one of his incredible exhibits when I discovered this place.  I thought: This is the hotel for me.  And indeed it has been.\n\nThere is a pretty atrium at the center of the hotel that fills the space with both volume and light.  There is also a pleasant roofdeck with nice views and a small but serviceable pool.  There is also a gym facility on that top level complete with sauna. \n\nThe hotel rooms are spacious, nicely decorated, well-appointed,  and clean.  The rooms all have large expanses of paned windows that let in a lot of light or if you prefer, can be completely closed off,  plunging the room into sleep-inducing darkness.  Some of the hotel rooms face the indoor atrium  rather than the outside.  Be sure to let  your preferences be known when making a reservation.  \n\nThe Warehouse District neighborhood has a lot going on for itself as well.  There are several notable restaurants including Emerils and Cochon within a couple of blocks walking distance.  \n\nDown the street in the opposite direction is Mother\'s Restaurant which is an institution in New Orleans. I love Mother\'s and most of the time, that\'s where you\'ll find me for breakfast.  You are also only a block away from the Wine Institute of New Orleans.  Check out the reviews on that...it\'s not to be missed.\n\nThe area also boasts a number of interesting art galleries and a glass blowing studio.  There is at least a day\'s worth of sight-seeing right outside the doors of this hotel.\n\nThe hotel restaurant, La Cote Brasserie has a bar where I\'ve happily spent my share of time over drinks and oysters.\n\n\nHad I written this review last year after my stay, I would have given 5 stars.  One star is lost this year because we were in a room that had a door connecting it to the next room that initially turned out to be less than ideal. \n\nThis connecting door made the room less soundproof than one would expect..  \nOn our first night there, I was awakened by our ""neighbors"" on the other side of that connecting door, having what I will only say was a quite loud and frisky time of it.  Egads!\nThe next morning, I spoke with the concierge about this and learned that this vocal duo had checked out so we opted not to change rooms.  The remaining nights were quiet.  But I\'ve learned my lesson and when making a reservation next time, will be sure to indicate that I don\'t want a room that adjoins another via a connecting door. \n\nHaving just returned from New Orleans, I feel wistful as I write this review, missing the hotel, the town and all the neighborhood attractions I\'ve mentioned.  Can\'t wait to go back and when I do, I\'ll be staying here.', 'I am still a fan of this location. The property is well maintained and competitively priced for travelers who know their way around the city and have little desire to stay in the CBD/Central Business District. \n\nThe hotel is located in the warehouse district and is a manageable to the CBD or Lee Circle. Valet Parking is as high as parking prices in downtown Chicago and the meters are $3.00 an hour. \n\nThe hotel restaurant, Legacy Kitchen has great offerings as well. If you are a Gold or Platinum Elite member, you are offered a credit each day for Legacy and given access to an area with free beverages and snacks. \n\nIf you a visiting Nola for the first time with a plan to hang in the French Quarter 24/7, this is probably not an ideal location. But if visiting with a vehicle and plan to venture around, the accommodations are great.', 'I stayed here for a night so I would have somewhere to crawl to after my high school reunion. It was super close to the venue so it was all I really cared about. The front desk was really nice and very professional. They get an extra star for the app which was easy to use and able to check out on it. The rooftop pool is pretty cool, but small and when I went to check it out on a Saturday afternoon it was very crowded. \n\nSome (very minor) things that could be updated. The clock radio which included a CD player. It would be better to offer a more basic clock than to have one that is so antiquated. Some hotels have docking stations for an iphone or ipod which is nice. The curtains had some really weird stains on the bottom. It was questionable, but the rest of the room appeared to be clean. The phone was giving us issues when we tried to call the front desk. We requested extra pillows, but never got them.\n\nHaving Legacy Kitchen and New Orleans beignets attached was a nice perk. Having good, affordable and LOCAL food so nearby was convenient. The breakfast definitely saved me the next morning.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,30.0

However, there is a city parking lot across the street with free one-hour parking. \n\nAll in all, the current owners have done a good job of maintaining the standards of Cid and Bernie Moon."", 'I decided to take my parents to breakfast here. I remembered the great food I had there about five years before, when it was under different ownership and in the neat place with the gift shop. It had a kitschy appeal to it and clearly much more discerning staff to order the food through.\nI can\'t say I like the wide open staging of the site now. It is personal preference however. Unfortunately, the service on this day suffered.\nThe place was deserted when we walked in the door. There was not one table with anyone at it. This should have been a clue to cut and run, but I was determined to reminisce old times. We finally decide to seat ourselves. After about 10 minutes the two waitresses appear and one of them hands us menus and pushes for us to make a decision immediately. After explaining we needed time to look at the menu we are bereft of a waitress for another 15-20 minutes. \nThe food was o.k. We were having a rather late breakfast, so my mom ordered a chicken sandwich. She ate one of the two breaded and fried strips that came in it, after peeling off the bun, cheese, and some sauce she didn\'t appear to care for. She ate some of the fries. My son and daughter ordered pancakes and eggs. They are satisfied with almost anything, so there was not issue there. \nMy dh and I ordered an egg dish. I ordered the Denver omelet, but having serious digestive issues with true meat, I asked to substitute the sausage in it for veggie sausage, as I thankfully had the option. We are served our food and I ate about 1/3 of my omelet before I came upon a big enough chunk of sausage crumble to realize it was in the omelet. I guess I should have asked the waitress to verify I got what I ordered when the veggie sausage was served on the side, but she was scarce as water in a dessert. We were lucky to get our orders in.\nAt this point, it\'s too late for me. I\'m going to be in pain all night long thanks to this mistake. I have to wave down the server and point out the mistake. She immediately becomes argumentative and angry, insisting that I should have clarified what I wanted. I calmly state that I thought ""substitute"" meant switch one for the other. When she get irritable about why it should matter, I try to explain that I have digestive issues that prevent me from processing animal protein and cause me abdominal pain; hence the substitution of veggie sausage. This is embarrassing enough, let alone to have to explain it to someone who clearly gives me no credence. She just huffed off with her nose literally in the air. \n\nSo now I have lousy service, a meal I cannot finish, and I get a night of serious pain to top it off. I hear another waitress behind the counter ask what happened as the cavernous room allows all sound to travel, even when not confrontational with customers. I also clearly hear her yell that I already ate half my meal before complaining. I\'m sorry if the real sausage was in such small crumbles, that with the fluffy scramble consistency of egg, other mix-ins and cheese, I couldn\'t see it. \nAfter a minute or so she huffs back to the table and begrudgingly offers to take 1/2 off of my meal. Never mind that I had not touched anything else...not the toast, not the side, nothing. I had less than 1/2 of 1/3 of all of my meal....so yea....1/2 off sounds great. \nAs if this was not enough, I was using a coupon which forced me to give miss no-manners an 18% gratuity. Never again will my family set foot in this place. I might be naive in thinking so, but I believe that when you are in the food business you need to take careful note of what substitutions or removals people make in their food because there are so many food allergies; some of which can be life threatening. I say this coming from the experience of working a waitressing job myself. Apparently our waitress did not agree. \nIn total, I walked away very hungry because I ate 1/3 of one omelet for the whole meal, I was looking forward to a night of sleeplessness due to severe abdominal pain from having real sausage, and I had to pay for parking that in all reality should have been free if the waitress had gotten around to waitressing in a reasonable time (1st hour is free and we were 1/2 a block away.) Oh, and the icing on the cake: as we were leaving I see someone through my peripheral vision and turn to follow the image, to see her glare at me and literally stick her nose up in the air and turn around to huff off once again! This is on par with the worst service given....ever.', ""After being informed that Moon's had changed locations as well as chefs, I decided to give the joint another shot.  I'm very glad I did!  The new location is darling with décor that is eclectic and lovely and lends to a very all-American diner feel.  The service is still as friendly as ever.  The food, however, has improved dramatically.  I ordered their breakfast burrito with a side of hash-browns.  The browns were crispy and everything that hash-browns ought to be; the burrito was meaty and delicious with just the right amount of heat in the salsa.  The coffee was hot and fresh (served from a carafe thereby avoiding the burned flavor that is an unfortunate quality of most diner coffee).  My dining companion ordered their Hobo Benedict which consisted of a large split biscuit covered in fried eggs, sausage, and cheese and smothered in gravy.  He was delighted (which was a relief, as he had previously been disappointed with their gravy). \n \nThe one thing I would mention is that the service is a little slow, which is expected from a bustling diner and certainly didn't bother me or my dining companion in the least--but may be something to consider if you are limited on time.\n\nOverall, a pleasant dining experience at their new and rather charming location.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

Is Mena's fancy? No. Is it pretty inside? No. Is the menu exotic, or daring, or going to push your culinary mind? No. So then, why such a high rating?\nThe answer is simple: Food Quality + Service. And let's be honest, whether you are a dollar menuaire or you only eat in restaurants with a sommelier, there are only 2 things that decide if you will ever eat there again. You can overlook wobbly chairs, loud noise, and tables so close that if someone is sitting at the table behind you, no one can get up. But if the food and the people providing it don't give you good vibes, there's no need to go back (see my Country Flame review). Mena's is a family owned and operated restaurant one block into the Quarter. They serve breakfast and lunch only. They offer daily specials as well. I have never had a bad meal. Their red beans and rice are particularly tasty (though I will say this last batch was not seasoned as well as it usually is). Their beet salad will send you into a tizzy. They only offer it twice a week. I could eat a bowl of it as a meal. PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY A BOTTLE OF THEIR HOUSE ITALIAN DRESSING!!!! I keep a bottle at home and at work. I am a BIG fan of salads, and this dressing is so good you can put it on naked iceberg with absolutely nothing else (no tomatoes, no cuke, NOTHIN!) and you will devour the whole thing and drink what's left in the bottom like leftover milk after a bowl of Apple Jacks. This was not an exaggeration. I've actually done just this. \nSo, in summary, this is like going to eat at that bomb auntie's house that's got the hamhock looking upper arms and the giant wooden spoon and fork on the kitchen wall. It's homecookin."", ""This restaurant has been opened since 1973 and has survived Katrina's disaster. We arrived here very early in the morning and fortunately the owner, Mena, arrived early to let us in at 7am. She warmly welcomed us to MP and explained a little history of the place and how it survived the Katrina's disaster. It was so nice meeting her, the chef Gregory and her staff. They are all very friendly and aimed to please. \n\nFor breakfast, I had The Vegetable Omelette which included sauteed spinach, tomatoes, caramelized onions, bell peppers and cheese tucked nicely in the omelette ($9). The grits are good and you can have your choice of wheat or white toast with a variety of jellies. All breakfast items are served with grits or hash browns and toast. The variety of omelettes are priced at  $6.75 to $10.\n\nI also tasted Cajun Tasso Omelette which was delicious ($10). It was filled with smoked ham and cheese wrapped in a triple layer of omelette. This time the meal came with hash browns and toast. The hash browns were done perfectly, much to my delight. MP takes credit cards like Visa, MC and AMEX. There' s also an ATM machine inside the restaurant  if you prefer to use cash. We met Gregory the chef and complimented on his good cooking. I would recommend this place for a delicious breakfast, fast service and friendly staff to begin your day. If you like your food spicy, try some Louisiana Gold Pepper Sauce. It will definitely wake you up besides the freshly brewed coffee here. \n\nThe lunch menu included Po-Boys, sandwiches, steaks, salads, pastas, a variety of seafood and daily specials. Looks like the menu has a little something for everyone, including desserts. I hear the bread pudding and rum sauce is very good here. Mena's Palace do delivery as well.

Let me tell y'all, the clubhouse is swanky! \n\nJust look at my pix and compare the regular ladies restroom to the one in the clubhouse. My friend Steve I always makes fun of the fact that I take pix of ladies restrooms but for me it's a big deal if it's clean. A dirty restroom doesn't bode well for the cleanliness of a joint for me. Besides, I have the tiniest bladder known to man so I'm always going to the bathroom so I want it to be a pleasant experience! \n\nAnd the clubhouse has bars, seating areas, big screen tv's and a couch room so you never miss the game.

They have added new bars, renovated suites, and even added a kid-friendly area called the STEAM zone. The STEAM zone is really neat with interactive activities for the kids that teach them the science behind basketball. You can learn about the anatomy of a basketball shoe for instance.\n\nOther things that I love about the Smoothie King Center include the Porch Bar which overlooks the whole arena. It is located on the 300 level and gives fans a chance to watch the game by a bar without having to go into the seating area. The two bunker bars are probably the coolest spots in the whole place.....nice lighting, plenty of seating, private seating areas, and nice restrooms.\n\nOverall the arena is very nice now with lots of new or renovated areas. The fan experience here has been much improved!"", 'I always enjoy visiting the SK center. Much smaller than other arenas I have been to. They have pretty decent overpriced food and drinks. Definitely not as expensive as sports centers in other cities. \nRestrooms are clean. I like the Pelicans, even though no one else seems to! It is fairly easy to find inexpensive tickets to any game or event. \nParking is fairly ample. Most sports centers have a pretty terrible traffic flow situation before and after events.

It stands for everything that's wrong with Boise- massive new construction, questionable design, expensive rooms... BUT. If you are visiting Boise or know someone who is, you really can't beat the brand-spankin'-new rooms, cleanliness, and amenities. Free Mercedes bus airport shuttle? Check. Beer or wine and snacks upon check-in? Check. Beekman toiletries, fluffy white bathrobes and slippers? Check. In-room dumbwaiter so you never have to answer the door for room service naked? CHYEEECK. \n\nShuttle pick up was smooth and easy. I even received a text message from the van driver to let me know that he was waiting for us upon landing. Check-in was also quick and friendly. They even had an iPhone cord that I could borrow for the night since I forgot mine at home.\n\nWe stayed in a King suite with a large, well-equipped bathroom and a two-person jetted tub set off in the corner, right across from a small private balcony. I enjoyed the spaciousness - and the privacy - of the suite, from the separate chaise sitting area to the table/desk and the comfortable king-sized bed. We couldn't resist immediately turning on the water for the bathtub (which comes from the ceiling and splatters everywhere... cool look, weird design), and even using the gas fire place. \n\nCheck out was just as easy. \n\nNow, I lived in the area for years. If I still lived here, would I be complaining about how everything is changing (no parking lot, no Dunkley Music across the way, about five downtown hotels already up or going up since I left in early 2017!)? Of course I would. But now that I'm back in Washington, this would be my hotel of choice during return visits for being close to everything: BSU, the airport, and all that downtown has to offer. It's a great central location for sightseeing, music festivals, or travel to all points around the beautiful state of Idaho. I, for one, have a thing about brand new, extremely clean properties, thick white towels, fluffy slippers, crisp white duvets, and super duper comfortable beds. Sorry, locals! I'll be back!"", ""I plan to update this review after Jan. 27th and we've had a chance to stay here. As for now, this review is to comment on the building and staff. \nI was waiting for a friend to grab a cocktail at the newly opened Richards, the hotel restaurant fur Inn 500. However, when I entered, Bailey at the front desk offered me a tour as I waited. In addition to the hotel being stunning, she was the epitome of professional. I felt like I wasn't a stranger off the street, but perhaps a shareholder surveying my investment property. She shared the vision of its proprietor, the history of the local artwork, the inspiration for the various room themed decor, and the future plans for the expansive spaces tucked inside. \nThe rooms are stunning. So much so, that without a good reason, I did indeed book a stay. I'm hoping for the wine themed room! But I'm looking forward to checking in and getting the complimentary local beer/wine, relaxing in the people-watching lobby, (not) working out in the stunning gym, and dining in the new-but-old Richards. \nI'll keep you posted!!""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,50.0

And since then it has won me over with bold beers, stellar food options, and a great outdoor seating area.\n\nWhen I first read about the aforementioned beet beer I was scoffing at the idea but also very willing to try. And when I did it Beets by J added up to an unexpected win that also showcased their willingness to go beyond the typical IPA overload that most breweries do. And even though they also do pale ales like their Rye Bread IPA, and juicy milky mosaic hopped Super Villain very well; they continue to make bold new beers like their kettle sour Fruiti Di Bosco made with 3 kinds of fruit puree, and their Night Howler Imperial Stout.\n\nFor awhile I knew all this beer stuff about Urban Village without actually visiting the spot thanks to going to fests and grabbing cans at other spots. But upon visiting I instantly enjoyed things like brussel sprouts sauteed with bacon and spiced sweet potatoes, smoked wings with a Moroccan chili sauce, and beer fries with a manchego cheese sauce. I also made note to try things like their pizzas and pork belly sandwich on future visits. The beer was even better in flight form, and the outdoor area was huge and perfect for a good weather day.

The smoky vanilla porter was a stand out in their selection but I think my ride or die will be the Wildey Wheat. It's such an easy beer to drink. The pizza on the other hand is TOP NOTCH. I love a chewy crust that has a little umph to it. My favorite so far is the Rita, which is just a classic margarita pizza. Just thinking about it makes me want to stop by for happy hour...which is awesome. $10 Rita's and $3 8oz pours. I like that they do their 8oz's on happy hour so you can try a bunch of brews and find your favorite. I think they have a few other pizza's at the $10 happy hour price but Rita is my homegirl. I was impressed that they even have a vegan (no cheese) pizza and other vegan options.\n\nStaff is a little squeaky but that's what you get going to a brand new place.

The restaurant is small, and so the place fills up quickly at lunch. They have a couple of larger tables inside, which are stacked up with communal diners, and a few smaller tables to the back. Most folks were taking their orders to go, as this place seems quite popular with nearby residents and business workers.\n\nParking is atrocious in this section of South Howard, so be prepared to circle the block while looking for a space in their tiny shared parking lot, or else bring a designated driver while you dash inside to pick up your to-go order.\n\nSo Fresh has a lot of customizable bowls, salads, and wraps, along with their homemade soups and smoothies. This style of healthy eating has become popular lately, and though it can be pricey, it\'s certainly a tasty and filling lunch.\n\nThe menu is displayed on big flat-screen TVs over the front counter, with constantly-scrolling pictures of the bowls, add-ons, and a list of ingredients.

Wraps start at $8. I ordered the Greek bowl, which was made with brown rice, onions, diced tomatoes, spinach, feta cheese, cucumbers, and house-made tzatziki sauce. I topped that off with seared Ahi tuna for a $3 up-charge. If you want to eat super healthy, they you can top your bowl with tofu or Zoodles (zucchini noodles).\n\nWhile waiting for them to prepare my Greek bowl, I also ordered their homemade chicken veggie soup ($4), which was a fantastic blend of veggies and slices of chicken breast simmering in a very tasty broth.

I was a ""high-five"" delighted customer of that Certified and grieved (seriously - my heart hurt) when the owner decided to close his business and sell the building.  So I was intrigued when owners of The Wylder eatery announced plans to open a bakery - cafe keeping Certified in the name.  A nice nod to the history of the building they remodeled here.\n\nWith all that as context, I offer up this fan-review for the English Muffins alone.  Having yet to brave the chaos of the North End and what I know to be woeful parking in this neighborhood and at this location (as place holder, the back door entrance to Camel\'s Crossing is just across the lot from Certified) to visit this new business myself, it was a wonderful surprise when a friend (who shall remain nameless but initials are Joy W) gifted me with sleeve of Certified\'s fantabulous English Muffins.\n\nI am something of an English Muffin fiend, which means I am no expert but a really big fan and my friend read my mind because although we had not talked about English Muffins,she figured I would love these.  And I do!  Split in half with two forks, like a proper English Muffin should be, and double toasted at home in my wide mouth Breville toaster (which I bought specifically with proper bagels and English Muffins in mind) they crisp up with perfect nooks and crannies to receive whatever it is you want to top them with.  \n\nI hope to get into Certified soon.  In the meantime, just a note that the English Muffins are fantabulous.  \n\nAnd also a note that Certified is offering pre-made meals in a case in the eatery - they told me when I inquired - which includes lasagna (the Wylder\'s recipe), mac n cheese, chicken pot pies and vegan enchiladas.  Not on their web site - so far - or a printed menu for these but a heads up for busy weeknight convenience!', 'Update \'heads up\' for a new ""Thursday Family Meal"" that Certified offered for the first time this week (8/20/20) as delivery - including for a nominal fee to my distant from Boise location of Eagle.  Most of the quality ingredient Boise eateries we enjoy don\'t deliver to our neck of the woods and that Certified is on our quality list and delivered for only $10 gets a ""woohoo"" from us!  Delivery in Boise proper is only $5. Or you can pick up the meal at the eatery.\n\nWe are \'well seasoned\' home cooks who source mostly local ingredients (so we have high standards for take away) and enjoy cooking a lot (it keeps us sane in crazy times).  But it is lovely to have good food at home that one neither has to cook themselves nor make the almost one hour round trip to Boise locales to pick up! (We choose not to use Uber or GrubHub knowing how they financially bleed independent eateries already working on slim margins.)  \n\nCertified offers this family meal sized to serve 2 or 4 people.  I hope it is wildly successful so they\'ll continue to offer it and we can continue to use it.  Check Certified\'s Facebook page or website for more information.  But the basics follow, keeping in mind this is a new program for them and so subject to change.\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n\n*They announce the menu on Friday or Saturday with orders needing to be placed (by email) by 5p Sunday for the meal choice for Thursday delivery.  Tip: Get on their email distribution list to receive this directly.\n\n*Confirmation of order email is by email.  Tuesday or Wednesday they call to collect credit card payment information and confirm the Thursday morning delivery time.\n\n* Delivery was spot-on on time in the Thursday morning window, the delivery person - who was owner in our case - wore a mask and stood back after ringing bell to see if we had any questions before leaving.\n\n*The packaging was perfectly done - not all takeaway orders from all places get this right and it is so important.  All items are refrigerated on arrival and with clear, easy to use instructions on how to reheat those that need reheating when you\'re ready to do that. \n\n*Dinners can be enjoyed day of delivery or up to two days later per the instructions.\n\nTHE EATS: \n\n*On inaugural week there were 3 options to order:  roast Mary\'s chicken with chimichurri, brisket with gravy and veg lasagna.  All came with salad of super fresh mixed greens with grilled nectarine, goat cheese, toasted almonds.  The chicken and brisket options also came with an orzo side that had fresh cherry tomatoes and corn in the mix.  (We chose the chicken option and Mary\'s is a quality brand we use too.)\n  \n*Prices were $30 for service for 2 or $55 for service for 4.  Pencils in at $15 or less per serving.  For top quality, generous portions and delicious food it is a great value. \n\n*You can also order add ons to your delivery from a set list of options including a couple of cocktail mixes (remember this is the same family that owns The Wylder for the bar there), desserts (we chose yummy nectarine and blueberry crostata - $6 each - from Certified\'s bakery), breakfast \'you-bake\' scones or their wonderful English muffins (a half dozen of these - $9.50 - were also on our list), housemade pickles and more.', 'A couple of ""ho-ho-holiday"" tips about take-away meals and good gift ideas all in one because in addition to baked goods - and excellent English Muffins (see first review) - Certified has prepared meals and soups to go in the freezer case in the shop.  Good prepared food makes a welcome gift any time of year: think as for working parents with school age kids, parents with a new baby, neighbors who just had surgery, your host and hostess who probably don\'t need another bottle of wine but who can always use a frozen meal to heat and eat next week, senior aged friends and family who have trouble cooking for themselves... The opportunities to share these - and to buy them to use at home - are boundless all the time including holidays.  \n\nThat\'s the top line.  Details follow.\n\nALL THE TIME OPTIONS:  You\'ll find in the freezer case. (Have tried them all.)\n\n*Certified Lasagna with beef, Italian sausage, pancetta of The Wylder recipe - this is the same family that owns that downtown area eatery (in small and large sizes to feed from 6 to 10 I think - $39 & $78)\n \n* Mac n Cheese in super cheesy four-cheese style using penne (in small and large sizes to feed from 4 to 8 I think - $12 & $24) \n\n*Chicken Pot pies (to feed 1 or 2 with lots of tender chicken, peas, carrots, potatoes in delicious sauce and excellent crust -  $14)\n\n*Vegetarian Enchiladas (small - 3 enchiladas fed 2 at our house- and large sizes - filling may change seasonally but our winter purchase was cubed roasted sweet potato and pintos with just enough chili kick - yummy - $12 & $24)\n\n*Assorted 32 oz soups - we picked up Tomato Bisque (still in our freezer) and Pumpkin Curry (delicious) and also saw Potato Leek and Veg Chili in the case.\n\n(12/27 update - Certified offered wild mushroom VEGETARIAN LASAGNA as an option on order in advance Christmas holiday menu - I ordered a couple.  A bit much cheese for us but glad we tried it.  If you enjoy super-cheesy style lasagna this is a fit for that preference.)\n\nSPECIAL HOLIDAY MENUS 2019:   This year they offered holiday specialty take out menus for Thanksgiving and Christmas, both of which required placing orders several days in advance by email or phone and picking up orders in a specific time window on a certain day.  Convenient if you\'re hosting or being hosted to be able to pick up good food to go and if they expanded the pick up day and time options that would be even more swell.\n\nFRIDAY SURPRISE I HOPE THEY\'LL CONTINUE:  As ""What a GREAT idea"", for a couple of consecutive Fridays Certified posted on FB that they were offering rotisserie whole chicken, roasted veg and ciabatta one week (biscuits the other) as take out for $35 (+/-...the price varied).  Limited amount, pick up starting at 5:30ish.  The first week was first come, first served and they sold out quickly.  The second week they offered \'call to reserve\' option for the 5:30 - 7:00 pick up window.   PS - being the ""Portlandia"" type I am I did ask where the chickens come from and the answer that they are Mary\'s organic - a very good brand - makes this all the more excellent. \n\nSERVICE:  Friendly, friendly, friendly.\n\nPARKING:  A considerable challenge in the North End and in particular for people like me who need accessible parking.  (I have had MS since college days.)  So it goes.  For anyone who doesn\'t live walkable distance from Certified, this North End neighborhood parking is a bear.  That is what that is.  And it is what keeps me from being a regular here.\n\nACCESSIBILITY:  Newly opened as remodeled from a building that was once Certified upholstery and rug cleaners, this is one of the few businesses in the North End that has tried to be equally accessible for people with mobility limits. ADA met for entry the door, standard height seating availability and the loos too.  Good for them for those minimums met.  The Civil Rights law of ADA is 30 years old so they should be no surprise to a building designer.  Yet I saw a wheelchair parked outside on snowy day because path of travel when people are inside was too narrow for minimum passage required.\n\nA NOTE ON SEATING IF YOU\'RE EATING IN:  Seating at low tables is convenient for eating a bakery item or sandwich.  But it is not particularly comfortable as seats themselves are smallish round stools.  This is probably a ""perch and go"" even for someone of my size 2 frame and maybe really not comfy for larger folks to be a ""linger and nosh"" kind of place for that reason.  But it is a pleasant space with lots of light and sparkling clean decor.  For me it will be all about the take away I think.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,

I had to insist that he at least take my name but he refused to take my phone number- ""we don\'t call out."" Calling back to see if I could retrieve $/books, I was told my name was not in the log, my books were nowhere to be found and that the owner would call me.\nIn a lousy attempt at being diplomatic, he called to basically say he would have to make up some credit amount to give me, insisting that I should basically be thankful for this.

Some old nice editions and some newer pretty expensive design books, things ive seen in used book stores for good amounts of money (there were at least 3 books that sold for around 40$ each in there). None of that matters- i\'m being offered a meager flat rate trade: come in in the morning to pick out a book....... only to get a call back that they actually wont be there tomorrow, followed by far too-personal details of the owners schedule and health.\nI genuinely want to support local businesses and I had fond memories of this place going back to when they were on south street- it\'s romantic, a place filled with old books, a stereotypical disinterested younger man and a oddball caricature for an owner.

Aebleskivers. \n\nIf you are looking for a quaint place to enjoy breakfast, French Toast is the place for you!\n\nWe dined at this great little gem a few times for breakfast, and enjoyed it so much. I love the fact that it is not indigenous or typical to the area, but rather a unique and interesting find. In many ways, it reminds me of West Coast yumminess. It absolutely is worth going for breakfast.\n\nDiners Tip- use the Yelp app for call ahead seating. It's a smaller restaurant, and they get busy pretty early in the morning.  We lucked out, and we were seated fairly quickly each time.\n\nEach meal always included Aebleskivers.  If you've not ever tried them, it is like heaven to your taste buds. They are danish pancake balls that are traditionally served as a dessert. Remember, life can be short eat dessert first!\nYou have your choice of fillings-lemon curd, warm chocolate etc. you can order them in threes, or fives etc.\nI highly recommend the lemon curd. It is the perfect taste sensation. They are brought to the table warm, and should be enjoyed immediately. They are pretty much hollow on the inside which allows you to easily open them up and add whatever your choice of filling maybe. Once you fill them, bite into that yummy goodness, and your life will be completely changed. I love the fact that while they are slightly sweet, they are not overly sugary, and it is the perfect treat to have with a good cup of coffee.\n\nI absolutely loved my toast with the smoke salmon. It was rather odd to have it with a scrambled egg on top which is their recommendation, but I will tell you, it works. The smoked salmon is not overly salty, is a fairly generous portion, and the combination of all the flavors together make for a perfect harmony.\n\nThe crêpe that we ordered that was filled with the banana and the Nutella, was definitely way too sweet for me, and I preferred the savoriness of my salmon toast.  \n\nThis definitely is the perfect place for breakfast when you are burnt out by the heaviness of the local fried treats, and you are looking for something completely unique and wonderful. I highly recommend the salmon on the toast! The entire menu sounds incredible, and I look forward to going back and trying other dishes. They do offer other dishes that are savory, in addition to some of the sweeter sounding counterparts. This is definitely a place worth checking out!! \n\nDon't forget the aebleskivers !!!"", ""This brunch was INSANE and I am so incredibly happy we had a chance to eat here! My boyfriend and I woke up on a Sunday ready to eat, but we knew the lines for brunch and lunch would be insane. Luckily, I noticed that French Toast features the Yelp Waitlist feature, so I added our names to the list while we walked the 20-minute journey to the restaurant. It felt really comforting to see our place move up in line in real time. We used those extra minutes beforehand to explore the French Market a bit nearby, and before we knew it, our table was ready.\n\nWe were seated at the counter, and were overwhelmed by all of the incredibly unique brunch options. I started off with a pomegranate mimosa (YESSSSSS!) and my boyfriend ordered an Irish coffee. These were the best decisions. If you want something cold to drink, I recommend that mimosa, and for something warm, go with the coffee! I dare you!!!!\n\nPicking something to eat was extremely difficult, because *everything* looked incredible. I wavered back and forth between the fried oysters avocado toast (c'mon, that sounds ridiculously good) and the king cake french toast. I ultimately went with the french toast, which was a very, very good decision, because it was stuffed with cinnamon cream cheese. How dare they, honestly?! How dare they come up with something so fantastic?!?!\n\nAlong with our individual meals, we asked for an order of aebelskivers, because we saw pretty much everyone around us eating these powdery treats. If you're even mildly curious as to what these would taste like, ORDER THEM. Just do it, and get the jam to dip them in. The aebelskivers here are warm, doughy, and topped with powdered sugar. Like a lil' beignet. This was the perfect addition to our brunch!\n\nThank you to the sweet staff at French Toast and those who created the menu. I highly, HIGHLY recommend this spot for brunch. Add yourself to the waitlist... now!"", ""Another place that disappointed with not only the food but also with service. Yes they were busy on a memorial day weekend but the servers were in rush to get you through the experience quickly. \nYou can join the waiting list on Yelp, but you'll have to check in within a given period of time. It also tells you how many parties are ahead of you. \nFood wise, coffee was just okay, chicken was dry in fried chicken sandwich and we couldn't finish it, omelette was plain, very plain and I've had better.

I saw that they made souffle\'s and I was like, "" Oh hell yes."" So after some convincing, my husband (remember he\'s cheap), agreed and we went for our wedding anniversary. \nThis place is kind of hard to spot from the road: it is a white building that says Le Rendezvous on the side, but if you\'re driving it can be difficult to see from the road. The inside has a bistro side and a restaurant side--the only difference is you see the specials on the bistro side. We chose the restaurant side because we looked at the menu online beforehand, and had an idea of what we wanted. I remember the bread was freshly baked, straight out of the oven and we couldn\'t stop eating it. It took a good amount of self-control to not ask for another basket. My husband got the steak frites and I got the scallops. The steak was cooked a perfect medium/medium-rare. The scallops were also cooked perfectly, not rubbery or raw. The garlic aioli the scallops came with was really flavorful and added depth to the overall dish. For dessert, I got the souffle and since my birthday was only 2 days prior, we got a free creme brulee. \nI love this place and again I am really glad I found it. I wish everyone to try it because it is truly a gem.', ""We recently spent our one year anniversary trip revisiting where we got married, minus the stress and the guests!  Wanting to go off of our resort for one night and enjoy one of our favorite foods/meals , we were lead to Le Rendezvous. Because we were staying at our wedding venue on Starr Pass, and were likely to have wine, we took an Uber. For a few minutes, I wondered where we were headed, but the lengthy trip was worth it! We were warmly greeted and seated in the dining room upon our arrival. The dining room is small and quaint and the Rat Pack crooned over the sound system adding a nice ambience. It was, our wedding reception music, after all!! Did they know?! There is a Yelp check in offer for a gratis glass of wine , but we opted for a French 75. This classic lemony martini topped with champagne was handshaken at our table.. the extra left in the martini shaker for us. Nice! I would not come close to finishing this drink and I knew pretty quickly that if I tried, I would be done. It was good, but it packed a punch!! The wine list, primarily French wines from all the various regions in France, was impressive! I spent several minutes trying to decide what would be my wine for dinner! Our server, was so gracious and friendly .. he knew the menu backwards and forwards and recommended dishes and wine to me when I was hung up on what to order. The menu is classic French but was missing Foie Gras, which I love ! He excused himself for a second and asked the chef if they could grant my wish: Voila! Wish granted! I ended up not going with the foie gras, after all of that, as my main was a Beef Wellington, which is rich and wrapped in foie gras. Can I ever just make my mind up ?! I started with the Salade de Epinard: a spinach Salad with carmelized sweet onions, chèvre , perfect crisps of lardons amongst the perfect Dijon vinagrette.. THIS could have been my main! I was quickly taken back to Cafe du Trocadero in Paris where I had this salad all the time ! My husband ordered the pate to start. This starter was a tremendous amount of pate! So rich and filling ! He also had the Gratin du Oignon, a steaming rich , bubbling gratin of French onion soup that was bubbling with delightful Guyere cheese on top. Next we both opted for the Beef Wellington. This isn't a dish that is often offered on menus and I've only seen it once , maybe?, in Phoenix .. so it's a treat, when prepared correctly. This Beef Wellington was an ample serving of filet , tucked amidst foie gras and baked rare within a perfect , flaky warm crust that was melt in your mouth heaven! Our dishes were served with crisp yet tender pomme des Annas, potatoes that were just perfectly crisp and seasoned and also vegetables to balance the meal. This Beef Wellington was outstanding and perfectly prepared! There was so much of it, and it's so rich , there was no way either of us could complete our meals. This wasn't your typical upscale meal, where the food is all about looking decorative and not a lot to eat; NO! These portions were a lot for a French , upscale restaurant! Next came out dessert, the waiter brought us a Grand Marnier Soufflé to share for our anniversary celebration ! The concierge at our wedding resort must have set that up! Literally, I've never seen a soufflé so puffy and perfect! It came with Chantilly Creme and again... so very French! This meal was one of my husbands and my favorites likely for the year... and as you can see from my reviews, we travel and we eat a lot!! I can't say enough about Le Rendezvous and how amazing the food was here! The entire experience was almost as perfect as it could be outside of France... even the waiter snapping at his helper was authentic! ( Yes! We could hear that from our table 'number 2' !! :-) ) Finding good , VERY good French food in Arizona is hard.. this is the place! Merci Beaucoup!!"", 'I was very impressed with this place. Very classy joint, I felt very under-dressed (but then again I was wearing shorts and a T-shirt, so my bad). My wife and I came in right at the end of their lunch service, so the place wasn\'t quite empty, but you could tell things were winding down; by our waiter\'s demeanor, however, you would never have known they were about to close up. Our waiter was great, very patient, and urged us to take our time. We started with the baked brie appetizer, and it was fantastic. Brie covered in a puff pastry, accompanied by what I believe were caramelized pears and a tangy balsamic vinegar. For the main coarse, I ordered the beef wellington, and shortly after it came out, my brain exploded. First time I\'d ever had a beef wellington, so I have nothing to compare this to, but it was a revelation for me. The most tender beef, gently engulfed in a pastry crust, smothered in gravy (or au jus, but whatever it\'s all gravy to me), with hidden nuggets of fois gras nestled within it. The beef just melted in my mouth along with the pastry and I was in heaven. This is one of those rare meals that, when you finish, you are genuinely sad that it is over. I\'m pretty sure my wife ordered something too, but I couldn\'t tell you what it was because I was far too focused on mine. 90% I didn\'t even say 2 words to her during dinner service because of my mouthgasm. I guess what I\'m trying to say is: ""Order the damn beef wellington!""\n\nIn summation, go here.']",0.0,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.0,1.0,50.0

I think that is it, or maybe something of that nature. I came on opening day to only find out they were sold out of this creamy cheesy goodness by 6 pm.  I mean c\'mon, this is probably some of the best mac and cheese out there, I wouldn\'t expect nothing less coming from Mac Mart. \n\nI could place the blame on Mac Mart for dropping the ball in not having enough, but I won\'t.

I will say this, my second visit made it even more pleasurable where the expectations were met.  \n\nMac Mart, I am clearly infatuated with your mac and cheese. A cheesy decadent bowl of gratification is what you\'ll be diving into. Mac Mart has their well known signature bowls, their concocted blends that will seriously have you saying "" I want that one, and this one"" . They also have a make a bowl where the options are endless, and there goes any kind of self control you think you might have. I am strong and secure enough to say it happened to me, I fell victim to this.  \n\nI went with their Wit Mac, which by the way was not an easy decision to make. A ""Wit Mac"" bowl is prepared with  cheesesteak, caramelized onions and a potato crunch laying over top. So friggin good, but I added bacon, along with sriracha to this work of art.

I see some complaints that it\'s ""pricey"" for mac n cheese, but I don\'t agree - each item on the menu is less than $10, which is a great deal when you compare it to restaurant prices for the same thing. In addition, their ""flavors"" are all so creative - my friends and I ordered quite the variety so as to get a good sampling.\n\nMy personal favorite (and the group\'s): In the Buff, AKA the buffalo chicken mac n cheese. The creamy ranch and buffalo buffer the richness of the cheese w/ just enough spicy kick and give it this savory goodness that makes you take bite after bite. I want to go back to Mac Mart and eat In the Buff all day every day.\n\nRunner-up: Roasted Red Pesto - if you like veggies and pesto, this is the one for you! The Jalapeno Popper is great for those of you who like spicy and cheesy. The Rittenhouse is reminiscent of spinach and artichoke dip - creamy and rich. I don\'t think you can go wrong at Mac Mart, each option on the menu looks great! I\'ll definitely be coming back to fill in my punch card (buy 10 get 1 free!).\n\nTip for the owners, if they see this: I love the tupperware and I\'ll definitely be re-using mine!

I mean, you cannot have a conversation loud. I bet the cool air will be nice this summer though!!', 'Urban South was founded by Jacob Landry.  They opened their doors in March, 2016. Jacob is a native Louisianian.   The seeds for Urban South were planted during Jacob\'s college years when he lived in Europe for a stint.  He fell in love with the European brews and wanted to bring that home to NOLA.  The history of beer in Louisiana is interesting.  There used to be a scene, but it died away, and has only saw a rebirth in recent years. It seems a step behind other cities, like the beer scene in Austin, TX for example.  The mission of Urban South is to ""bring the heritage of European beer making with the ""brashness"" of American styles"".  The tasting room and production area are located in an old warehouse district.  We had a hard time at first finding the entrance. We walked around the huge warehouse until we found it!  The interior is open and quite large. I have never seen such a family oriented tasting room!  They had a bouncy house and many kid friendly areas.  I am not sure if this was just for a special event, or if they have something similar on weekends often.  There was a football game playing on the TV\'s and many locals were just hanging out with their kids playing around them.  We saw several pizzas get delivered while we were there.  The staff were friendly and knowledgeable.  My husband and I each tried a flight.  They offer free tours on the weekends.  My husband had been trying local beer throughout our stay at local establishments, and this was the best of the trip!  He even bought some cans to take home with him.  I don\'t love beer, but I enjoyed all the beers in my flight (that\'s saying something!). I found them to be well structured and balanced.  The merchandise here is some of the best I have scene.  We don\'t usually buy stuff, but we bought a jacket, shirt, and glassware.  I would definitely recommend a visit to this brewery if you are in the area. It will be a to do for every visit. We really enjoyed our time at this family fun hang out spot with good brews.  They seemed to have large fans with large warehouse doors that open up. So I am not sure if they have AC.  It may get hot in the summertime.  We went in the fall so the weather was a bit cool. WE just kept our jackets on.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

If I can hold a sandwich with one hand and not both, we got problems. \nI can do without the Potato Chips filler in the basket. At least put good potato chips in there if you\'re going to do that. I know they have to try to make it look like you\'re actually getting food here, but you\'re not. \nThey can keep those, and should serve a more decent sized scoop of potato salad or coleslaw  instead of the small souffle cup serving that would normally be used for a to-go side salad dressing. That\'s sad. \nThat should not be considered a side that comes along with your meal. Take an ice cream scooper, save your soufflé cup and plop one scoop of potato salad In the basket. \nDITCH the cheap chips! You save way more money getting rid of those chips, saving the cups which are pricey alone, and you have a way more satisfied customer. You\'re welcome.\nIt didn\'t help that they were out of potato salad, and I was stuck with coleslaw . \nI actually love coleslaw, so I didn\'t mind, until I realized how much I needed the potato salad to help fill my stomach because of the small portions . \nI wanted more food! * pounds fork on table repeatedly *\n, but I wasn\'t about to drop 40 just for myself on lunch. \nI was hoping the Yelp check in offer for free bourbon street pudding(also made differently)would help the void in my stomach.

It was filled with chunks of lobster but I wish they would season it more. It\'s lobster + mayo on bread. Am I missing something? \n\nThe homemade chips and potato salad weren\'t anything memorable as well. Not bad, no good, just meh...\n\nOverall, I\'m stuck in the middle about Lobster Haven.

There aren't many tables, but it wasn't that busy at lunch on a Monday so it didn't matter.

You can definitely get in and out of here in less than an hour.\n\nFOOD: This is the best part. The food is spectacular. We started with a cup of clam chowder. It was thick and hearty. I've never had a clam chowder that was so thick before. It must have been supremely rich, but it didn't taste that way. There was a ton of clams. I could wax poetics for hours about this clam chowder. Just writing about it makes me want to go back and get a bowl of it! The lobster roll was also delicious. My dad was a little surprised that it was $21, but I find that it the going rate for lobster rolls in Tampa Bay. The crab cake sandwich was also fantastic. (I think the theme here is everything is great). If I had to choose, I would probably go with the lobster roll over the crab cake, but by a slim margin. I tried both the potato salad and the coleslaw. I liked the potato salad better, but both are pretty good. They give you a ton of chips, but don't waste your stomach space on that. It comes out of a bag, so it is nothing special. When we checked in on Yelp we got a free bourbon bread pudding! It's homemade and it is sinfully good. I had to tell them we weren't going to take the rest home because I knew that it was slowly killing me. Right now, writing this, I am mourning that decision. It was so moist because it soaked up all the sauce and slathered in icing.

It is lightly crunchy, garlicky, juicy chicken;  a couple of  drops of Louisiana hot sauce and I am  in fried chicken nirvana.  \n\nOther dishes that are exceptional here?

Li\'l Dizzy\'s Cafe is far and beyond one of the addicting restaurants in NOLA for me.  No, it\'s not Michelin rated, it\'s not run by a celeb chef or restaurant group.  It\'s small business that people come to over and over.  You don\'t come here to be seen, to eat posh, but to feel essence, that essence of food culture, so unique yet consistent, divinely satisfying.  It\'s a meal celebration of giving thanks.  Take heed,  the unforgettable deliciousness of the flavors here, draws a loyal crowd day in and day out:  visitors from Japan/Europe (were here last), savvy eaters from all over the country, hungry travelers like me and athletes (yep a couple of  Saints were here when I visited a few years back.... ""Who Dat!"")\n\nOne day after umpteen trips to NOLA I discovered why Nawlins is fat, deliciously fat-- that for the first time in my life, I saw nothing wrong with that. And I\'ve got just the place to get deliciously fat.  Sunday after church, the congregation shows up at Li\'l Dizzy\'s, because part of the fun here is falling in line here and waiting, and basking in the delicious aromas of a Cajun Creole kitchen perfected.    It\'s a dive of a place, one of my favorite kinds of place to eat.  The anticipation builds and by the time you get a table in this tiny home-converted into a restaurant,  you are ready for the most memorable meal you\'ve had in New Orleans.    For when you bite into the perfect fried chicken with a drop  (just a drop) of Louisiana hot sauce, you wonder why KFC and Popeye\'s exist. The seasoning of the breading is a statement:  light, crisp, the salt teasing your palate, a drop of hot sauce and Bam! (smile, Emeril).  You just discovered fried chicken like you\'ve never, mis amigos!   For when you bite into the perfect plate of mighty greens you taste  life enhancing minerals and quickly realize why people in the South who have a heavy greens diet live long lives.  But when you come here and you are served the perfect bowl of gumbo (andouille, crab, shrimp, chicken) you are mesmerized;  for your palate has not been treated to a kaleidoscope of French/Creole/Cajun tastes. I\'ve tasted gumbo from all over NOLA (about 30 restaurants) for gumbo. For to this humble diner,  nowhere in New Orleans has someone concocted this caliber of  gumbo recipe.  This bowl of creole ingredients ( tasso, filé, seafood, a well made roux all cooked low and slow) is something  I cannot forget  (im convinced it\'s the crab that makes this pot of goodness). This  gumbo is so perfect I crave it, I wake up in the middle of the night and have hangry pangs for it.    \n\nThen that bread pudding.   You take a perfect corner piece, you know, the corner with the crisply amber caramelized crust (like Massimo Bottura\'s crispy burnt edge of the lasagna); you swipe it through the deliciously perfect whiskey butter sauce,  you are thankful and swear you\'ve found a place you will come visit every time you are in New Orleans.  You are thankful that a cuisine that everyone else loves in New Orleans, you do also.\n\nThere are many places like Li\'l Dizzy\'s all over our great US of A, humble, tried and true that fill our yearning for traditional dishes, that bring everyone together.  And every Sunday, people come here in droves, after church to seek comfort and this year,  I think of Li\'l Dizzy\'s as a place to give thanks to and be grateful that traditions like this and Thanksgiving  live in the hearts of many.  I\'d get deliciously fat in Nawlins and at Lil Dizzy\'s any day!\n\n\nHappy Thanksgiving To You and Your Family!\n\n\nVisits: a few\n\nTip:   Parking in the neighborhood.

Wasn't long before we grabbed a tiny table close to the door, I took my napkins to wipe the access water from the wet wash cloth used to clean our table before sitting.

The happy hour is so convenient because it's 5-7 instead of 4-6. It's also a deal because they do half off drafts. I've found that overall they have a good craft beer selection. They also have their bar snacks for $5 but it's not really a deal....I just go for the nachos which are unfortunately still full price.\n\nThe nachos are $9 + $3 for seitan but they are HUGE and made my boyfriend and I full. They layer the nachos so as you dig down more you uncover more delicious layers. They also put a lot of jalepeno which I like. Last night when I visited we were able to get 4 beers (3 of which were the Philadelphia Brewing Winter Wunder) and the nachos for $24 without tip. I was tipsy, full, and happy. \n\nThe only weird thing is the drink menus are a super weird font making them hard to read. I casually said something to our waitress and they reprinted them making the words larger but not fixing the font. She even turned the lights up and we strained to read it. They also have a venue upstairs so while we were finishing up, we could hear the band sound checking upstairs so it might get loud when they actually start playing. \n\nFinal Verdict: If you are looking for something cheap and delicious while also getting a little tipsy - check out the happy hour here."", ""Not gonna lie, I didn't know what to expect reading some recent reviews hat were really mixed, but WHOA was I pleased! This was a last minute option, but a great stumble upon. The waitress let us know that their pizza was made by Pizza Gutt and I knew we were gonna eat good. \n\nWe ate outside and it was a bit cold, but I was too distracted by how good the pumpkin spice beer paired with the pepperoni pizza I ordered. The pizza was one of the best pies I've had in YEARS. The crust was charred perfection and very fluffy and light, yet crispy. The sauce was seasoned so well and jus enough cheese, but not overbearing. I only ate half and had the rest the next day. \n\nThis $17 price point for a pizza pie was well worth it."", ""Bourbon and branch has had a major glow up. Their menu is at least 50% vegan and they have a ton of deals. Even with all the vegan stuff this place will even have food to keep my mother happy (her name's literally Karen so you can imagine).\n\nAfter seeing an Instagram post of their nachos yesterday I visited on a whim. I also ordered some seitan wings cause why not? With Blackbird and Soy Cafe down the street, this place really brings them some competition. Wings were great, the Korean bbq sauce was not my fave but they have like 5 flavors so plenty of things to try. The nachos were earth shatteringly delicious. They actually layer them properly so you don't get to the bottom and have empty chips. They also have great prices for beer. My husband got a pilsner they had on special for $5 so I can only imagine it can get even cheaper if you go for happy hour. They also had the eagles game on so if you're a sports person it's a great place to catch a game.\n\nI think the bartenders we're training last night but they were super friendly and helpful. I didn't order a drink so something I know that can turn them off but I really appreciated the great service (sorry I didn't catch your names!) \n\nHonestly, I can't wait to come back. They have so much other stuff to try plus they carry beyond burgers/sausage (yum). Take your vegan friends here.""]",0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333,1.0,30.0

I often wondered who in the heck would grab a bite here, of all places. I then kept reading about this place in many different local magazines and most recently from a review on yelp, Misty. I decided today was the day I would whip the car in here and check it out. I soon found out I had been missing out all of these years.\n\nAs I walked up to the window the nicest man said "" Hello  beautiful lady "" with the warmest smile on his face. He had such a sweet calming demeanor about him. He immediately knew it was my first time. I quickly discovered I was talking to the man himself, Paul. He set me up with a Chicago dog and fries. I also discovered this wonderful man and his dogs have won more awards than you can shake a stick at. Quietly proud he is and with good reason.\n\nBrought my hotdog home and demolished the entire thing. I\'m not a big hotdog person but I\'ll tell you what, the next time I\'m craving one I know where I am headed...... Chicago Paulies. \n\nPaul, if you happen to read this, it was a pleasure meeting you and I wish for  you continued success.', 'Chicago Dogs always thrill me\nAnd I wish I could get them for free\nBut this one is quite cheap\nAnd my love of it runs deep\nSo come get Chicago\'d by Paulie\n\nFlorida has no beautiful Fall leaves\nFor that journey up north past Raleigh\nBut it\'s still worth your Trivago\nBecause just like Chicago\nThey have the best hot dog at Paulie\'s!\n\nThe taste makes my kittens all scamper\nBarbie\'s damp, but this dog makes her damper\nAuthentic Windy City\nIt\'d be such a pity\nIf you didn\'t try Paulie\'s in Tampa!\n\nWhat to get: Chicago Dog\nWhat not to get: Chicago Cat\nWhy: I have enough cats tyvm\nWhat else not to get: Chicago Cat\nWhy this time?: might get into fights with your Chicago Dog\n\nMy car went missing while I was waiting for a dog. Paulie was like... ""hey where\'d Chicago?"" \n\nTo get good Chicago-style food outside Chicago is a lot harder than it sounds. The vast majority of ""Chicago eateries"" outside Cook County are less ""Windy City"" and more ""Causes Wind."" However, there are a few gems out there. Diamonds in the rough that are as good as anything in Chicago itself. And Paulie\'s is one of the most glittering of those diamonds.\n\nMy notes said: The best Chicago dog I\'ve had outside Chicago - anywhere in the country. If it were in Chicago, it\'d be top 5, maybe even top 3. It\'s that good, it\'s that perfect. I was shocked. Long wait. Love Paulie too.\n\nSo here\'s the full version.\n\nThe last thing I expected when I pulled up to this truck despite all the good reviews was for it to end up being better than some of the Chicago stuff in Chicago. Yet that\'s exactly what I found - and even though the wait time is long, I could not have really liked it any more.\n\nWhat a Chicago dog is, for the uninitiated, is basically a delicious IL-made dog on a steamed bun, with all sorts of pickles and sport peppers and onions and relish and mustard and tomatoes... it\'s basically been dragged through a Midwestern farm and has ""all the veggies."" It tastes remarkably spectacular. It\'s not sugary sweet at all, so don\'t ask for ketchup. Not only will that ruin it, but it\'s offensive to native Chicagoans.\n\nPaulie\'s is a truck, and I did just keep the car running for the AC - you should too, if it\'s a really hot day, cuz if anyone is in front of you the food can take a little while, but it\'s very much worth the wait.\n\nWhat you must understand is that I\'m obsessed with Chicago food. And I know it very well. Deep Dish Pizza isn\'t something Chicagoans really love. But if you want Pizza in Chicago it\'s Art Of Pizza (local) and Lou Malnati\'s (chain). There\'s only one Italian Beef *in the country* that I love. It\'s in the West Burbs of Chicago. Portillo\'s can go suck a lemon... it does nothing for me. For that reason, I\'ve never even tried the Italian Beef here. However when it comes to Chicago Dogs and Polish Sausages, I start salivating and having tummy palpitations that have a distinct midwestern drawl and sound more like Capone than I care to admit.\n\nI\'m extremely picky about my Chicago stuff and I will say Florida generally has low food standards. But there are exceptions, especially in Miami and Tampa, and this is literally one of the very best - and most authentic - out of town eats you\'ll find anywhere in the state, and made by a wonderful guy as well. You simply must come here if you like Chicago dogs. Or if you don\'t know whether you like them, this is a hell of a place to find out... because pretty much nobody in the US makes them better than this.\n\nBon Jovi would like to finish up this review:\n\n""Livin\' On A Pair""\n\nPaulie used to work Tampa docks\nUnion\'s been on strike, he was down on his luck, it\'s tough, so tough\nNow he works a food truck all day\nServing hot dogs, Chicago all the way, Poppyseed Bun... but I can\'t live off just one...\n\nHe said you\'ve got to hold on to both sides of the bun\nIt doesn\'t make a difference, order 2 and not 1\nBut don\'t ask for ketchup, cause it\'s not done\nThat way...\nThese hot dogs are great!\n\nWhoa, it\'s halfway eaten\nWhoaho, it\'s like a veggie dog with meat on\nTake my Sausage and put it in your mouth\nI ordered 2, and there\'s no other food about\nLivin\' On A Pair!', ""This is as truly as it gets for a Chi town dog in Tampa!!!!

They provided a great hotel room. It had huge high ceilings, the pictures don't do them justice. In fact I think this hotel had the highest ceilings I've ever seen in a hotel room. The room had a nice view, very clean, and had friendly staff throughout the hotel. It's in a perfect location for Mardi Gras whether you are there to party or to enjoy the city. \n\nWhen I checked in they gave me a Mardi Gras bag , 4 cups and beads. I loved it! Also because I'm a Hilton member I got a free snack and drink... food always makes me happy.  They always made me feel welcome and answered all my incessant questions. I have lots of questions. \n\nThere is a fitness center and free Continental breakfast from 6 to 10. The continental breakfast included things like eggs, potatoes, oatmeal, omelettes, waffles and more. Even though I couldn't wake up in time to get breakfast much I did try it one day. It was what you would expect for a continental breakfast. \n\nOne of the best things about this hotel was their location. There was fried chicken, pizza, and Starbucks right around the block! And Bourbon Street was right across the street. If you're coming for Mardi Gras you are located in between two of the biggest streets,( Canal Street and Saint Charles). They are on each side of you so it's impossible to miss the action. This can be a plus or a hindrance because when the parades are running you will not able to cross and so  getting around town will be hard. If you came to party like our group, Bourbon Street is only a few blocks over. This was a great thing because if you're drunk all you need to do is stumble a few blocks over. And if you're sober you will definitely be able to find your hotel since it's only across the street.\n\nThere is a lot of craziness going on outside and I was happy to see the hotel provided excellent security. In fact there was usually 5 security people blocking the door once it was evening time. They did a great job  protecting the hotel guests and not allowing other people in. We had to wear wristbands the whole time we stayed there to show we were hotel guests. \n\nEven though our hotel was by all the action it was still far enough away for you to get a good sleep! I love my sleep! Beds were nice and soft and I slept like a baby! I'll definitely be back!"", ""I can't say enough nice things about the Hampton Inn on Carondelet Street. When I booked it I wanted to be close to everything, I didn't realize that the street turns into Bourbon Street and was the perfect location. This hotel was wonderful and I can safely say the best hotel I have stayed at in New Orleans and there has been a lot! \n\nWhen I arrived they told me the hotel room was not ready. I said that is fine and since I am Gold I got some snacks. They asked me how many people were in my party and I said 4. They asked if I would like a free upgrade and of course I said, Yes! Usually when I get a free upgrade it is usually just to a room a little bit bigger. Or a room with a better view. Not here! They upgraded me to a full on suite on the 10th Floor! It was the biggest room I had ever been given! It was amazing! \n\nThe room was awesome, the maid's kept the room very clean and cozy while we were there. The breakfast at the hotel was good, but it was traditional Hampton Inn breakfast! \n\nThe only issue I had was the night security was extremely rude. My friends and I were talking at a normal tone. We enter the hallway and go to the elevators and they stop us to tell us we are extremely loud and need to tone it down or were getting removed from this hotel.... Are You kidding me?!? I quickly made my way down to the front desk to report her and the hotel sent up some more snacks and apologized and told us she was new! You don't treat a guest especially a Dimond member with Hilton that way. The hotel took care of it so no need to take the stars down. We saw her the next day and she apologized and said she had the wrong room the noise was coming from. \n\nOverall a wonderful stay. I do think they jacked the prices up but it was New Years Even 2020 when we stayed there. I would highly recommend!"", ""No view from this room on the 16th floor. Sure, there's a window but eight feet outside the window is a brick wall. Delightful.\n\nMostly quiet in the evening though some occasional hallway noise that went away. No slamming doors and no noise through the walls, which was great.\n\nOtherwise, comfortable. Firm bed, big shower with great water pressure. Location is good. There is no breakfast that I could see, thanks to COVID. Also, no housekeeping but they'll bring you more towels or coffee if you request it.\n\nThe hotel is near the French Quarter but has no unique character.

Luckily for us, Pasqually\'s is open until midnight, making it a default stop for hooligans and hoodlums looking for late-night food and booze.\n\nThe food and booze isn\'t bad. There\'s an impressive selection of 40s (I got the Troegenator, a delicious double-bock with 8% alcohol, for just $5.50!) and a gigantic cheese steak (enough for 2 people!) for about $7. It certainly wasn\'t anything special, but it was good enough. My friend Dan got a chicken cheese steak with ""the works"" -- apparently the works include lettuce, banana peppers, and Thousand Island dressing. Bizarre, but not terrible.\n\nThe tables are covered with ""vintage"" ads from the \'80s and \'90s -- i can\'t tell if this is for kitsch factor, or if they just haven\'t been updated in a LOOOONG time. I suspect the latter. There\'s also a few arcade games that seem straight out of 1989, and a kinda sketchy crew of hoodlums sprawled out on the booths, paper bag 40s glued to their lips. These hoodlums later displayed their impressive manliness by one after another, PEEING WITH THE BATHROOM DOOR OPEN while the rest of the clientele looked on in horror.  So. gross.\n\nOverall, I felt ok chilling at Pasqually\'s with my three male friends to protect me from sketch-tards, but would probably never come back here alone.

Good consistency, and flavors. \nThe Falafel, one of my favorites, was so moist in the middle and perfectly crispy on the outside . The kibbe was very flavorful and stuffed perfectly . Unfortunately, they only give one In the sampler. I will definitely order a side of those next time.

They will refill your tea cup with hot water if you ask.  I wish they would brew their own tea though and this would be a great thing.  \n\nMy favorite appetizer is the Foule.  It is puree of fava beans, some garbanzos spiced with garlic, jalapeno, lemon, olive oil and parsley.  It is served warm and with pita bread.  I love that this place gives enough bread and you do not have to ask for more.  If you are running low they ask you if you would like more.  Great customer service.

This was my first time having raw salmon and I must say chef aced it! I was hesitate at first. However, it did not taste fishy at all. It had a good flavor and the texture was better than I thought. The ice cream was also really good. I thought by the name of the flavors it would be very odd. However, I was wrong. My husband and I devoured both scoops of ice cream within minutes. The appetizer and main course meals were also nice and flavorful. Overall, Luvi is a good place to dine.

Besides the amazing special, our group of three had the Snow White, the Million Dollar Baby, the Under the Sea, the Dark Forest and smashed cucumbers plus five scented edamame. My other favorites were the Dark Forest (mushrooms and tofu) which came with rice and the Million Dollar Baby.  The cucumbers and edamame sides were delicious. We also had a beer, the mojito and a senseition. I had the senseition and the ginger/lime was strong but it was tasty. My friend loved her mojito and we just wished our waiter had actually checked back at some point to see if we would have liked more drinks.

I have never written lower than a 4 stars at the half dozen or so stores I've visited. This was my first time at this Tampa store located four miles from the airport. \n\nRight off the plane and practically to Total Wine prior to closing on a weekday evening. I only needed one bottle of wine, but it needed to be a great one and I planned on being picky. However I also had little time. \n\nWhat many customers may not know is the secret behind the staff knowing how to make recommendations. The receive a case of wine and beer a month to try, write notes and then make recommendations to customers. Throughout the store you will see this on shelves with the face of a staff member. This is legit if you ever wondered. I went right to work and asked a staff member to help me with a high end NAPA Cabernet that would be similar to a Caymus, but not priced at $80. \n\nThe staff discussed options and ultimately called the manager Doug to come over. After around 10 minutes of deciding on three choices I settled on a hard to keep in stock 2013 Baldacci Fraternity. It's a bold red blend with cherry and tobacco flavors. The maker even designed sediment to be in the pour like an old aged wine would be. The bottle was taken to a group dinner in St. Petersburg. I actually had this wine maker before and was excited. The wine proved to be marvelous at the $44 price point and opened beautifully in the glass. \n\nI will continue to shop Total Wine for the selection, price and more importantly the knowledge that staff have about products. Thank you Doug."", ""I have a lot to say about this Total Wine. I kinda think it needs 3 seperate reviews. \n\nReview Number 1:\n5 Stars for the Total Wine as a whole. It's clean, bright, and well staffed. The parking is ample, and there are multiple curbside pick up spots. I visited at 10pm on a Friday night and you would have thought it was the hottest night club in town. It was very busy. But since the store is so big you don't feel crowded. And multiple registers were open so nobody was waiting in lines to pay. \n\nReview Number 2: \n5 Stars for the online ordering, in store pick up. While I was frustrated initially that I couldn't order both of my items online for pick up (even though they were both in store, 1 just wasn't available for online pick up?? I still don't really know how this works) I was so pleased with process when I picked up. The gentleman was very busy! He was on the phone, processing orders, looking at inventory, and he still was able to help me all at the same time. AND he laughed at my joke and managed to stay friendly. This is the best Total Wine in store pick up service I have ever experienced. \n\nReview Number 3:\n5 Stars fro Caruso. This guy knows his stuff. It was the first time in my life that I have ever had such incredible service at a store. When I think about describing the interaction it completely sounds like we were sitting at a bar hanging out with the coolest bartender in town. But alas...we were standing in the aisle of a warehouse wine store. Caruso went out of his way, to engage us. Not because we asked, simply because he could tell we were chatty folks. I still can't believe that. As someone who managed retail the idea of an employee STOPPING their task, to engage with a customer would have made me soooo soo soooo proud. That is not service you can teach or coach, that is authentic and innate. This dude likes wine and likes his job and likes people. And I really like that. I can't believe I have to go all the way to Tampa to go to Total Wine now but I can't see myself going to another one ever again.  I hope he sees this because I want him to know he is awesome but also I don't because I want to play it ~cool~.

I like the Pinot noir particularly. Especially the Russian River Valley (RRV) Pinot Noir is my region. Not all year grape is good but most Year is above average in that region. I always try every Pinot Noir. I like Lost Canyon, La Crema, River Road Stephanie, Deloach - roughly $20 to $40 a bottle.

We also saw a Racoon and a bunch of turtles. I got to learn a decent amount about the river, Katrina, Spanish Moss, Crawfish, Snakes and more.

On a day that started off like it was going to be a complete wash with dark threatening clouds rolling in, we were hoping a Swamp Tour 30 minutes outside the city would save the day. Met a vendor while walking down Canal Street near Harrah\'s and he suggested Cajun Encounters. He recommended we drive to the location ourselves to save money since we had our own car, so we did. \n\nGETTING THERE -\nQuestioning the intelligence of our decision as we drove through a storm while exiting the city, we were delighted to find clear skies just a few miles after hitting the road. A quick prayer for a good day seemed to be answered as those dark clouds decided not to follow us... which made for a beautiful day in Slidell, LA.\n\nWell off the main highway you will find them near an old mechanical bridge. Once inside, you\'ll may find a small line to pay for your tour. You\'ll then receive a colored rubber bracelet indicating your tour group. We were very fortunate to have Captain Mike, a down to earth born and bred Cajun who really knew those swamps.\n\nTHE TOUR -\nThe first half of the tour was quite boring as Captain Mike went  over a little history of the Bayou and drove high speed thu the more open areas of the swamp. IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO SEE GATORS, this will be a hit or miss experience. We saw a few, but they were reclusive and didn\'t seem to be interested in the hot dogs Capt\'n Mike was beating on the water to coerce their attention.\n\nBut then we turned down a narrow heavily tree\'d area where you could feel branches scraping the bottom of the boat. Wife was totally paranoid we would get shipwrecked or something and Capt\'n Mike didn\'t help as he side swiped a few large trees... lol!!! You should have seen her face.\n\nTHE BEST PART -\nWell, we came to rest in a small cove and Mike pulls out Bryan, a little one foot alligator and my kids go nuts!!!! Normally well behaved children, I politely had to apologize to several people after Mike asked ""who wants to hold Bryan"". We were at the front of the boat you see, and Capt\'n Mike and Bryan were at the rear. If any of the passengers from our tour are reading this, I sincerely hope your feet are feeling better after being trampled by our overexcited boys!\n\nBryan was a big hit, and the boys enthusiasm gave several more people courage to hold the little fella, including my wife. But the big prize was yet to come. Mike spotted a HUGE gator who was not shy at all. For this gator he used a stick to dangle the hot dog and what came next drew lots of Oooo\'s and Aaaaaahhhh\'s. This gator came a clean 4 feet out of the water to grab this hot dog and we were amazed. It was just what we were hoping to see!!! Saw some other stuff on the boat ride back after that encounter but didn\'t care. That huge gator and little Bryan were all we talked about for a few hours.

A bit over a year ago they opened up a brick and mortar location between downtown Tampa and Ybor City. I had always heard such great things about them.

I arrived at an off hour during the week, so no wait for me. \n\nI'm not a big sandwich person, however when I tell you I was in heaven with my first bite of the steak sandwich, boy was I.

I also ordered the ham croquets. These consist of a breaded ham salad that are deep fried. They are served with a cheese sauce. Tasty, however much to greasy for me. These are quite popular.

We visited on a Saturday at around 4:30p, and while it was fairly crowded in the restaurant, there were definitely enough street parking spots available outside.\n\nWe went inside and because I was starving, I felt like a kid in a candy store, trying to decide on what to order. While just about everything looked great, I decided to go with the modified Cuban, Tostones and Croquets. My wife ordered the roast beef marsala.\n\nModified Cuban: 4-stars. The bread is some of the best I\'ve ever had. I do wish that the bread was pressed/toasted a bit more and that the meat was warmed along with everything else. Then again, this sandwich had won a lot of awards, so they don\'t need my help. Just my personal opinion.\n\nTostones: 3-stars. I didn\'t love these, but I didn\'t hate them. With everything else that appealed to me on the menu, I\'d have to opt for an alternate side on my next visit.\n\nCroquets: 5-stars. My favorite thing we ordered! My Cuban friends have turned me onto these, and I\'m still not sure what they are or how they\'re made, but what I do know is that they taste like eternal life. Eating a lot of them will probably give you the opposite of eternal life, but you\'ll definitely live a happier one.\n\nRoast Beef Marsala: 4-stars. I only had a couple bites of this, but I thought it was solid. My wife even said, ""I\'d give it 4-stars,"" unprompted, as we walked to our car. I\'ve officially become an influence in her life, apparently.\n\nI\'m really excited to see this place open. There was definitely the vibe of a big family in here when we visited. I\'m not sure if it was just because it was the second day, but everyone seemed to know the Faedo\'s and they were passing on lots of greetings and congratulations for opening. On top of everything else, I love the name ""Tampeno cuisine."" I hope that it draws in visitors, who are looking for local flavor, and I couldn\'t think of a better representative of that, than the Faedo family!', ""This is the type of Cuban sandwich that you can't stop eating. If you think that you are going to eat half now, and the other half later, well, I got bad news for you: it's not going to happen. If you want something for later, buy another sandwich. You won't regret it, these Cubano sandwiches are so good. The combination of amazing bread, well portioned ham and pork, good and plentiful Swiss cheese, and the right heating point make this sandwich an amazing dish. There are not many places in Florida that make amazing Cuban sandwiches, and this is definitively one of them. Tops for me at least.\n\nOn my first visit here, I only wanted to try the Cubano sandwich. I have tried them at other restaurants in Tampa, and Tampa had nothing on other rival cities that claim to have the best Cuban sandwich. After trying this sandwich, I have changed my mind and I must say that Tampa has a great sandwich, and MIchelle Faedo is one of two places that you need to visit.

Row zone popped up so I went ahead and purchased the 3 pack intro class. I signed up for my first of three, threw my workout gear on, and set foot for the gym one day after work. The instructor, who I will not name so as to not call out, said I could pick any rower, spent about 30 secs with me showing me proper form, and we were off on our workout. My experience fell short of my expectations, so much so that I dont know that Ill use the other 2 classes that I already paid for. So yeah, the 2 star rating is feeling more appropriate for me here. \n\nHere is what fell flat to me: \n- there were about 20 different movements for the class and each were covered in about 5 seconds, of which I couldnt retain all of that info so quickly so I was lost a lot in the workout \n- the instructor made me feel really unwelcome when they were making jokes about the two girls not saving the rower next to them for their friend who came in late (clearly the one I was on), so sorry to be the new person....\n- the class was all women, with the exception of one man. the instructor never acknowledged or gave feedback to the guy, only the women in the class\n- the instructor seemed a bit too chummy with some of the women, it was a bit odd for me\n- the instructor yelled through the class, no need for that friend \n- the people there weren\'t exactly the friendliest to me, even though I made it a point to share with a few different people that I was new (you know sometimes a gym is a great place to make friends when you are older and new to a city)\n\nHere is what worked for me\n- clean equipment \n- decent workout \n- decent music \n- I liked the variation of rowing and workouts \n- the workout was listed in a few places so it was readable almost anywhere in the gym\n\nI did try to give the gym another shot so as to use at least one more of my classes so one night this week I registered for a morning class. I woke up that morning not feeling well, tried to sign into my account from their website so I could cancel the class, learned that you cant sign into your account from the website after clicking every link on the website (wtf), and then resorted to emailing them asking them to cancel my class. 3 business days later, no response. That\'s pretty disappointing customer service wise. \n\nOverall, I am going to keep looking around for another gym as this place is not the right fit for me. Its hard to avoid that instructor and the customer service seems to be lacking. I\'d prefer to pay more for a more serious gym.', ""This place will kick your butt before you realize it! You will be sore forevaaa. \n\nI used to think rowing was all about those sexy backs *Que the JT* Nope, it'll work out your abs like no other and if you have proper form (which takes 5+ seshes to develop) an amazing leg workout. \n\nAll the instructors do variations of on the erg, off the erg doing an ab/leg/arm workout. I love that we alternate so that the 45min zooms by like everyone said. You're never on the erg for more than 7min I'd say. \n\nMy favorite part: Not pretentious. The other studios in CC have this feel to them. That $200 Lululemon yoga pant, judging you so hard for not being on a all juice cleanse, feel. These instructors helped you with your form and pushed you in a great way. Everyone was just trying to get a workout in and figure it out! \n\nMy least favorite part: The music suckss. It's kinda random like whatever happens to be playing on an old radio station? Nothing Top 40. Nothing hype.

They were nice enough to give us a tasting, but there were no stand outs. \n\nAnother disappointment was that the entire table did the Grand Wine Tasting, so we hoped this would push the food over the top. The wines were excellent- tons of refills, the problem was they were selected for a bad boring tasting. \n\nService was the high point and our waitress was as good as we have had. My suggestion for them is if you see a dinner going south, stop it. Be intuitive enough to intervene and flexible enough to make your customers happy, this is what the best restaurants do. They should have explained the problem, not charged us a premium for a boring and lazy menu. At a top Italian restaurant our same meal would have cost a quarter of the check without wine. And there would have been more food to eat and we would have chosen better. \n\nI feel bad saying, but this was the worst chef tasting I have ever had and the cost for a mainly vegetarian meal was crazy. They ran out of food... I ran out of stars, suck it up, don\'t rest on your reviews and own it. \n\nTIP: Consider not going on a Saturday night, as Chef Vetri is not working. \nTIP 2: Pick exactly what you want from the menu \n\nI welcome anyone from Vetri to respond to this review and explain what happened and why I had the world\'s most expensive almost vegetarian meal.', 'I\'ve had 4 months to write a review about Vetri and I\'m still at a loss for words for how I should describe my meal.  Is there a level above perfect?  Because there should be, and it should be called Vetri (Merriam-Webster, update your dictionary now).\n\nMy grand plan was to surprise my boyfriend for his birthday with a meal at Vetri.  Easy, right?  But one does not simply walk into Vetri.  No, this took some serious plotting.  I contacted the restaurant over a month out to see if they would be able to accommodate me, since yours truly has a plethora of food allergies.  ""No problem,"" they said.  I then proceeded to stalk them on Open Table for a solid week so I could snag a reservation (I swear I\'m sane) and then I anxiously waited for the date to arrive.  \n\nVetriland was everything I imagined it would be: impeccable service, exquisite food that I will never forget, amazing drinks...it was a beautiful dining experience.  I recommend pacing yourself as you go throughout the courses because this is a marathon, not a sprint.  Savor each bite and sip slowly or you won\'t be able to enjoy dessert.   \n\nAs if the whole meal wasn\'t enough, we were given an autographed, hand-painted menu and a brief tour of the kitchen.  All in all, it was the perf...er...Vetri evening.  Thank you for making me an unforgettable meal and helping me win the girlfriend of the year award.', '""Meet me at Broad and Spruce and dress nicely"" was all she said to me.  Apparently, my birthday dinner was supposed to be some sort of special occasion.  I put on my fitted shirt, pants, tie and laced up my shoes.  I could tell this was going to an evening to remember.\n\nAs we walked east on Spruce, she asked if I knew where we were going.  I shook my head unknowingly and then she stopped me and said ""we\'re here.""  It took me a minute to comprehend where I was and then my hands started shaking.\n\nWhen the door swung open we were greeted by well dressed staff members and sat in the corner table.  A glass of prosecco was handed to us to begin our meal.  She looked at me from across the table and said ""Happy Birthday""  I had to pinch myself to make sure this wasn\'t a dream.\n\nThe appetizers presented were a selection of cured meats, foie gras and vegetables with a balsamic reduction.  Each item was exquisite, highly precise and delicate.  We perused the menu and instructed our server to ""surprise us.""  With the recent opening of Alla Spina, we chose the beer pairing.  We chose wisely.\n\nMy toro wrapped around burrata was the opening part to the symphony of this meal.  Thinly sliced and dissolved on my tongue leaving only the creamy burrata.  This dish was executed flawlessly.  ""Are you crying?"" she said.  Of course I wasn\'t.  There\'s no crying in Vetri.\n\nI have no doubt that the staff at Vetri has sold their soul to make their spinach gnocchi.  This was the origami of pasta.  Perfect and precise in every way.  I knew they weren\'t playing fair when I tasted this dish.  The brown butter and ricotta salata just changed the game entirely.\n\nCrumbled lamb over house made pappardelle, sure why not?  How about poussin roasted with pig belly?  I was beginning to think that the Vetri staff was playing some sort of joke on me.  It turns out they weren\'t, the place is just that damn fantastic.  When all was said and done, a polenta chocolate cake with a candle came out just for me.  I\'m not used to this kind of attention.\n\nWhen I ventured out that evening, I wasn\'t prepared for the best meal of my life.  I now know what great food is supposed to taste like.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,80.0

The size of the studio and the instructor to studio ratio allows for some attention during challenging poses. I was always intimidated by inversions and I\'m now doing some with ease. The power hour and flow 2 classes have excellent instructors, and advanced students are usually in attendance who will encourage you. \n\nMy very favorite class and instructor is flow 1 with Tina.

The studio also hosts meditation sessions, book clubs, social hours, etc. What a great way to build a community of yogis.', ""I found Bella Prana by recommendation from a friend who LOVES the studio. Knowing my background as a yoga instructor in Los Angeles she knew I would love this place. \nShe was right! I have practiced with some of the top instructors in the world and taken yoga at the top yoga studios in New York and Los Angeles as well as doing three yoga teacher trainings with top studios like Yoga Works. This studio definitely meets my needs and reminds me of the large studios I use to practice with in L.A. It is such a wonderful vibe, amazing front desk staff who are very helpful, classes for every level, intelligent sequenceing ( which is important to avoid injury) and lovely teachers. I love Marley she has such  great energy and a caring heart. There are two showers and amenities when you come out after a hot sweaty workout. I took my boyfriend to a special workshop Roni was hosting and he walked out drenched and completely ZENed out! They have lots of workshops, a book club and a teacher training! They are even taking people to India for a retreat, which would be a dream to go to, next time! \n\nAll in all an amazing studio, I don't miss my big city studios when going here, a great place to practice!"", 'It saddens me to only give them 3 stars. At their previous location it would have been a solid 5. Jenny\'s review below pretty much hits the nail on the head. \n\nI\'ll start with the positives: Easy parking, good location, & a beautiful lobby and shop. Also, I love Roni\'s classes where she also incorporates a message it\'s almost like ""church yoga"" although her messages aren\'t biblical but inspiring. \n\nWhy only 3 stars? Since they moved locations, the vibe is different. It\'s hard to explain if you never went to the old studio. Yes, that studio was smaller but I think there was more of a sense of comradery amongst the students even though at times, we only had 2 finger widths apart from each others mats in the room - I didn\'t mind! I loved seeing a pack class and it pushed me to want to excel throughout the class.\n\nNow for the negatives. The majority of their great instructors had left to go another studio. Not sure why the high turnover, but Mallory\'s class really took my level of practice to another level. Also, they went off class pass! Unsure what benefit they received from that but that\'s how I discovered them to begin with a year and half ago. As the previous reviewer mentioned below, they always have room in their class! Very frustrating that they aren\'t on class pass - I\'ll just have to find a new studio to love that honors that.  One other negative is that the yoga rooms themselves need updating. The floors need to be redone especially in the hot yoga room. They should use the Zebra flooring that another studio has. It\'s a lot cleaner and easier on your joints. There\'s also an obstructing pole in two of the rooms that just breaks the vibe of the class. It\'s not pleasant to look at if you\'re in the back. \n\nAll in all, my love for Yoga began at Bella but I think until they make some changes I\'ll take my practice elsewhere.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,

He also suggested that we order something pan-seared and gave us examples of items that were. I took his suggestion and ordered one of their specials - a pork tenderloin, breaded and pan-seared, stuffed with ricotta, covered with sauce and cheese and then baked. I must say that it was one of the best Italian dishes I have had in a very long time. My wife had the Fettuccine Alfredo, with chicken. She gave me a taste: It was super authentic, not the Chef Boyardee stuff you get in practically any restaurant.\n\nTheir wine list, while still under development, was super affordable with plenty of choices. A glass of their house wine was $3.50, with prices going up on other wines from there. The house wine went perfectly with the dish I had ordered. My wife had Merlot (I ribbed her about ordering a red wine with a white sauce chicken dish, but the wine police never arrived at our table to haul her away) which she really enjoyed.\n\nWe were there pretty late during the week and the place was kind of slow, so our server had time to chat with us.

At this point I\'ve only had one dish, but it\'s incredible... smoked salmon and greens, tossed with olives, parmesan, feta and bow-tie pasta. If I\'m being completely honest (which I\'m going to be) the pasta doesn\'t do anything for me except make me feel like I am 5, so I ditch that. I also don\'t cheese it up because I\'m lactarded and don\'t want to suffer the consequences of devouring dairy. With that said, this salad is topped with some of the best smoked fish I have ever eaten.

I\'m told they smoke it there and I\'ve never come up for air long enough while mauling the thing to ask what that means. I\'ll find out though and tell you what I come up with.

On the other end of the spectrum, we all also liked the Ghost Station, a raspberry Berlinerweisse, which was a perfect mix of sour, salty and sweet, with this style of beer quickly becoming my go-to summer session.  The space is nice.  It reminded me a bit of the decor in La Colombe's flagship.  All-in-all, the grand opening left me excited to see what Crime and Punishment will churn out.

Hotel Mazarin gave me a comfortable and aesthetically pleasing environment to rest my weary head at night, and it\'s set in a prime French Quarter location. A few steps in one direction you\'ll find Bourbon Street, and a few steps in the other is Royal. You can walk to so many fantastic bars, restaurants, galleries, and shops all within a short distance. I encourage everyone to explore further (duh), but you could seriously be well fed and entertained without going far at all.\n\nI think Hotel Mazarin is lovely. I\'m a sucker for decadent historical stories (who\'d have thought I\'d love New Orleans?!), so I was happy about the portrait of Giulio Mazarini in the lobby and so nerdily excited to read the print out of his life story in my room. Ol\' Jules was a cardinal, a lawyer, a gambler, and a diamond collecter/designer. Whaaaat. Befriending kings and popes in order to gain higher positions in society, wooing queens with his jewels and developing battle schemes. Oh, the drama! I love it.\n\nMy hotel room was pretty little, but the bed was extremely comfy and I loved the black marble floors. I had a tiny window overlooking a small courtyard, and I was pleased with the well-working thermostat. I like a COLD room. Of course it was in the 40s and 50s outside during my stay, haha. I wonder if the temp could hold at 66 degrees in the sticky summer heat?! \n\nIt rocks that Patrick\'s Bar Vin and the 21st Amendment bar are both inside the hotel, especially since they\'re both awesome. I was also impressed by the hotel\'s complimentary breakfast buffet (a really decent spread of pastries, bagels, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, fresh fruit, etc.). However, I had a few not so positive moments with Hotel Mazarin that I cannot overlook: \n\n1.) My shower didn\'t give me hot water. At all. I seriously had to take a barely luke-warm shower (meaning it wasn\'t ICE cold but it was still cool), and it was so unpleasant. Some of my colleagues figured out a trick for unleashing the heat, and if that\'s the case there needs to be a diagram or something! \n\n2.) The front desk staff gave off some seriously negative vibes. I found at least 2 of them to be completely aloof and rude when it came to my meager needs (like getting into my room and being directed to one of the bars). I\'m not a high maintenance hotel guest in the slightest, but you\'d have thought I was making ridiculous requests by the looks on their faces. First of all, check-in was sloppy and weird. It took an unusually long amount of time for the whole ""initial this piece of paper and present your ID"" scene to go down, and then no one offered to help us with our bags or point us in the right direction when our struggle (overpacking) was clear. No ""enjoy your stay"" or even a well-wishing smile.\n\nAfter I was given my room keys I immediately went to my room, but neither key worked. No big deal. When I went downstairs to let them know, I was rudely lectured on how I\'d deactivated my cards. ""Don\'t put them in your wallet"" with an annoyed sneer, like I was a child who knowingly disobeyed just to get attention. I never put the keys in my wallet, but even if I had it shouldn\'t matter. I\'d expect to be given new room keys that work with a smile.\n\nIn the end, I had a positive experience here and I can see myself returning. But the not-so-helpful (or friendly) customer service was lacking, and that\'s the most important thing for me.', ""4.5\n\nI used to live in New Orleans. This was prior to Katrina and the livin' was easy. I had a brilliant 2/2 in a converted Lower Garden District mansion (across from Archie Manning's place, around the corner from the first Real World mansion and close to one of Anne Rice's spots)... and I didn't appreciate it. I was young and inexperienced and I thought that everyone had formal dining rooms, 15' celings and walk-in (as in multiple steps) pantries. Oh, youth. But, one thing I'd always wanted to do was to stay in the French Quarter. I'd eaten there. I'd imbibed there. I'd... well, I'm not going to tell on myself but I was young, single and a lawyer so... life was good. But, again, I never stayed there... and I regretted that.\n\nLife moved on, job opportunities took me away from the city that care forgot, the storm hit, and I didn't think anymore about staying in the quarter in NOLA. After all, I had other cities to visit. Well, after 10+ years, work brought me back to the city and I was determined to stay in the Quarter. Luck shined on me and I found a fantastic deal with the HM. I study of Yelp reviews let me see that I was in good hands. I booked the room and got excited about my trip. As soon as I walked in, I knew I had made the right choice: a huge courtyard, large ceilings, mirrors, be-our-guest service (including two comp drinks at 21st Amendment just because)... I was back in New Orleans. I knew the avoid a room that looked out over the dining courtyard so I was extra pleased when I walked into my back courtyard room. It was gorgeous: marble floors, French Quarter charm, big tv, complimentary water (it's the little things), pedestal sink, writer's desk, plantation shutters, free wifi, ornate (but not gaudy) furniture, a comfortable king bed, large (modernish) shower (a nice surprise given then classic amenities), and a plush robe. Yes. This would do nicely.\n\nThe location can't be beat: you're in the middle of the quarter but not directly on Bourbon, so the noise won't make you crazy. In fact, noise was never an issue. Some times, in older properties, the walls are thin and every creak, bang and pop becomes an annoyance. Not so here. Something else I enjoyed: the complimentary breakfast. This was no Holiday-Inn-off-the-interstate breakfast (not that there's anything wrong with that; time and place rules all). This breakfast was full of choice, fresh fruit/juice, meat, eggs, bready goods, and sweets. Add to the bounty, eating the food in an open air courtyard... it's perfect. It's New Orleans.

I found a float tank in Bristol but it seemed like to much of a hassle to get to, and a lot in New York - but when I had a chance to get to the city I never had the time to squeeze in a soak.  Fast forward to an article I saw on be well Philly - finally a spot was opening up right on girard!  Once the website went live I booked an introductory package and scheduled my session.  \n\nI didn\'t have any real expectations and knew that basically you get in a tank that\'s heated to the temperature of your skin, and float in a mixture of Epsom Salt and 10 inches of water.  You wear ear plugs, and lie in the dark all alone with you and your thoughts.  Sounds scary, but it\'s not.  The experience is yours alone and it is what you make of it. \n\nWhen the time came for my appointment I walked into a clean and bright space, and was greeted by a nice woman who immediately put me at ease.  She explained the tank and the process.  Each room is equipped with a private tank, a small shower, bath robe, towel, head pillow, ear plugs, and face towel with a water bottle to spray down your face in the event that you get salt in your eyes.  You even get a water proof light to bring inside the tank to help you until you become more orientated to the dark.  \n\nI am very familiar with the benefits of Epsom Salt:  first off your body can absorb a good amount of magnesium this way, Epsom salt is good for recovery from work outs or muscle aches and pains, It is known to detoxify, help your nervous system function, improve heart health, and just relieve stress in general. A 90 minute session here is a more than sufficient time period to reap the benefits of an Epsom soak. \n\nI went into the tank with my pillow and light, closed the door, and got situated.  You really do float in the water! The 90 minutes i spent in the tank went by quickly.  I had read that some people can really get into a deep meditative state, but I don\'t think I was there - yet. It was very relaxing and really very comfortable.  My mind kind of shut off, and it wasn\'t until she knocked on the door, to tell me my time was up, that I snapped back into reality and thought ""oh wow I\'m in a weird dark tank."" \n\nI took another shower, and this time I had to scrub all the salt off.  I did bring my own shampoo and conditioner - but they had all that there - I just am picky about products (ie LUSH products).  I use Epsom salt at home so I\'m very familiar with the drying aspect of the salt, so I also brought my own lotion.  There wasn\'t any lotion in the private room but I noticed some in the shared bathroom - along w contact cases and a blow dryer.  So I guess if you forget yours they have it available.  \n\nThe place was clean and besides the dark tank, everything in the space is bright and fun!  There is water and tea available when you have finished, and I think I even saw some snacks - but i was in a rush to go to a birthday party so I just popped out as quickly as I came in. I left feeling totally relaxed and very calm. I feel like the next time I go I will try to get a later appointment so I can go home and sleep after wards. I didn\'t leave tired or ready for bed, but I could see myself getting a tremendous nights sleep after going here later in the evening. \n\nI can\'t wait to float again- I could see myself doing this once a month.  It\'s really nice to go somewhere and totally check out, not worry about your phone or your plans or whatever - and just take 90 minutes to float away.', ""I'd been wanting to try a sensory deprivation tank ever since Lisa Simpson did it (http://vimeo.com/42916032). Now I have. I think I liked it, but here's a bit of what went through mind during my float:\n\nI'm scared. \nIt's dark in here. \nI need to turn this little light off.\nNo, it's too scary.\nWhat if I can't get out?\nI can do this. \nI love Epsom salts.\nCool, I'm floating. \nIt's fun to stretch in here.\nI'm probably moving too much.\nChill out.\nRelax your big toe, 2nd toe, 3rd toe, 4th toe, baby toe.....\nMy neck aches.\nI have mermaid hair.\ninhale-exhale-inhale-exhale-inhale-exhale-inhale......\nMy skin feels slippery.\nI'm a little bored.\nI have to pee. \nI'm cold.\nI'm hungry.\nWhen can I get out of here?\nHas it been 90 minutes yet?\n\nAnd then the music started & I was so surprised that the 90 minutes had gone by because it felt more like 1/2 hour!\n\nI liked it, I definitely liked it. It was relaxing & I like anything that forces me to be away from my phone. I felt great afterward--super relaxed, no aches or pains, & super strong the next day.\n\nThat being said, I probably won't go back. I recommend trying it at least once, because floating is pretty awesome. For the time & money, though, I'd rather get a massage."", ""I never did anything like this ever until yesterday. To be honest, I was a little unsure how I was going to react in a sensory deprivation tank. (It sounds so much more intimidating than it actually is though.) First off, I have pretty above-average anxiety- I cry on airplanes that hit turbulence, get cold sweats when the dentist comes at me with a Novocaine shot, and I regularly envision myself in a horrific car crash while driving on 76. All crazy, I know. So the idea of an isolation tank was both intriguing and terrifying. And let me just say that is was AWESOME.\n\nUnless you've done this before or been in a space shuttle, you've never felt this. The sensation of floating is incredible and relaxing. Floating in the water after the initial period where you have to learn how to relax, for me was all about concentrating on the sound of my own breathe and heartbeat. It might sound difficult for many people- being alone with your own thoughts for 90 minutes - but for some reason in that tank it is easy to turn off the outside world.  \n\nThe tank itself is bigger than I imagined in my head, and the water is only about 10 inches deep, so immediately my anxiousness kind of left me and I closed the door and turned off the little floating light ball. Truth be told also, you lose time in there. 90 minutes felt like maybe 30. \n\nWhen I emerged from the tank I felt this incredible lightness. Like my body finally got a rest and was rejuvenated. I don't get that from sleeping... I wake up and feel the aches and pains of whatever I was doing the day before or for my last 33 years. When I walked out of that room, I felt like a weight had been lifted and I was renewed. I can see why some people want to do this all the time. \n\nHalcyon Floats is a lovely little shop. It's clean and quiet and the staff is so helpful and wonderful. They all float, so they are enthusiastic about the benefits and the experiences people have. They definitely helped to calm the nervousness I was having about doing it for the first time. Afterward, it was an added plus to be able to chat with them about the experience and hear about theirs.\n\nA few tips: you may not think that little scratch that didn't break your skin will not bother you but I can assure you ANY minor abrasion you have should be covered with Vaseline. I was scratching an itch on my shin and didn't know I had any sign of abrasion until I got in the tank and it started to become irritated VERY FAST. Covering it with Vaseline immediately fixed the problem. Lastly, have an open mind. Like most things in life, this experience will be what you make of it. If you want to go into the tank with skepticism and a closed expectation, you will likely not enjoy yourself. You've got 90 minutes in there with yourself, so relax and stay positive!""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,30.0

When I called to schedule my appointment, the options were overwhelming! The woman offered to email me the info so I could look it over with my husband. After receiving the info, I did some research and decided on the Crystalline, the highest quality tint (which they have priced reasonably, from what my research indicated). When I dropped my car off, I was waiting for my husband to pick me up when he called to tell me his car battery was dead. Of course, we don't have jumper cables. The ladies at Orange Tint and Tune kindly sent one of their employees with a jumper box to jump our other car at home, about 5 minutes from the shop. We were so appreciative! \n\nNow onto the actual tint work...they did a great job. I had some issues with my driver's side window because the window goes down ever so slightly when you open the door, which caused the bottom of the tint to lift before it was dry. Chet, the manager, noticed this before I left and said to stop back in if it caused me any problems. I stopped back in today and long story short, Chet decided to re-tint the window for me. He didn't think it looked 100% perfect and he wanted to make sure they got it right.\n\nThis business stands behind their products and workmanship. It is very clear that if something ever goes wrong with my tint, I can stop in and they won't hesitate to make it right. Their customer service is excellent as well.\n\nI would recommend them without hesitation!"", ""We had an early morning weekend appointment and waited while our car was tinted. Rosemary was really helpful in deciding which tint to go with, and overall was really friendly, professional, and helpful. The customer service at this place is hard to beat, and the adorable dog is an awesome bonus.\n\nIt's honestly really hard for me to give this place less than 5 stars because the customer service is so good, so I waited a few weeks before reviewing so I could be more objective. The reality is that the tint job we got was not very good. I've never used another place in Tampa, so I can't compare there, but I've had several cars tinted before elsewhere and never had the same issues. \n\nSo the job was this: remove the tint from a 2010 Civic, add a new tint. I know it's an older car and isn't going to be treated with the same care as a new car in many cases, but I can really only judge on my own experience. When we initially got our the back, there were a lot of issues with the quality of the tint, and there was glue residue and chunks of tint all over the inside of the car. The person who did the tint came out and looked at the car and honestly didn't seem very happy that we had issues, and attributed to the issues to his guy who was newer having messed up. But they were happy to schedule a day to redo the parts that were messed up, which I really appreciate.\n\nThat day I took the car home and spent over and hour trying to clean up the car. The residue was all over the doors, and it still remains. I scrubbed and scrubbed, used three different types of cleaners, nothing worked. When we went back to get the bad parts of the tint redone, they tried to remove it too and couldn't. So there are permanent stains on my doors. Since I'm not a car person and my car is older, I'm relatively okay with it, but it sucks to spend hundreds of dollars to end up with permanent stains on your car. They said it happened during the tint removal, which was a separate fee, and there was no offer of refunding that or anything. Had this been a newer car I probably would have wanted at least a partial refund, which they don't do, so I definitely would not get a newer car done here. Weeks/months later I am still finding random little pieces of tint in my car. I really feel that when you're paying hundreds of dollars, even if your car is older, some level of care should be taken.\n\nIn addition to that, the radio in our car no longer works when the rear defroster is on. This seems to be a relatively common issue when getting tints done, but worth mentioning as I didn't know this until it happened to my car.\n\nI do see that I'm in the minority in my experience. I believe this is at least partially because most people are going in to do a new tint and not to remove an old one.\n\nAgain, their customer service is great. Had the job itself gone more smoothly, this would definitely be a 5 star place. But overall, I sadly couldn't recommend this place to a friend due to all the issues with the tint removal and tinting, the cleanup time I had to put in, and the permanent stains on my car."", ""I called Orange Tint and Tunes on a Wednesday to get pricing on window tint for my new car and spoke with Rosemary. She was incredibly sweet and explained all of the product options telling me the pros and cons of each. She told me the pricing for each option and I decided to give them my business. I scheduled an appointment for the following Friday, and she gave me a call on Thursday to confirm my appointment.\n\nWhen I get there on Friday morning, she once again explained all of the product options and showed me a sample of each. I picked the option that I wanted, and she told me it would take around two hours. Additionally, Rosemary offered me a bottle of water, and gave me the WiFi password so I didn't have to use my phone's data plan.\n\nWhile I waited, the office dog (Lucy) roamed around and spent some time near me letting me scratch her head (she's really soft, and really friendly, and is a very spoiled pup). Before I knew it (less than 45 minutes later) the techs were done with my tint. While processing my payment, Rosemary told me how to clean the tint, gave me a cleaning cloth to use, and gave me a few warnings about not rolling down my windows for a few days so that the tint has time to cure. \n\nThe shop is incredibly clean and the bay where the actual work is done is enclosed and air conditioned. I was told about the tint warranty options, and given a warranty card that can be used anywhere that authorized 3M tint technicians work. I paid a little more than some of my other quotes, but I feel that the customer service I received, the cleanliness of the shop, the professionalism of the staff, and the quality of the tint job I received make the price well worth it.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,

Netflix doesn\'t have anything on these guys, mainly because the staff is super helpful. They pointed me in just the right direction, and I found ""Y Tu Mama Tambien.""\n\nWhen I got home, Cassie and my pal Rick were anxiously awaiting the movie; as soon as I opened the door, they shuffled in their spots on the couch really quick! I was excited, too! I like Spanish flicks, and plus, I didn\'t even know Rick was coming over! I thought the movie was pretty good, but Rick and Cassie REALLY liked it! They said they were gonna show it to our friend Ben, and they took off. Pretty sure it speaks for itself! Casa Video has just the movie for you, your loved ones and your friends--you just can\'t wait to share!\n\n***\n\n2/5/14: Woohoo, review of the day! I bragged about it to Cassie in my daily D-Blast to her (e-mail, text, voicemail, Facebook message and LinkedIn discussion forum), and when I asked if she\'d go on a date with me for 5 minutes for every friend I got today, she said, ""Whatever!"" LOL, I know that means ""Yes,"" so friend me!', ""Casa video always takes this old millennial on a trip down memory lane of many a video store trip with family and friends. It has that small town, local feel I grew up with- not a Hastings or Blockbuster vibe. \n\nGreat selection of movies new and old, stuff you won't find on Netflix! You can take your time browsing, no line of people behind you pressure like at a red box. Fun assortment of bottled sodas and snacks at checkout.

It was weird sitting in the area where the children's movies and VHS tapes used to sit. And get this: the children's movies are now stored where the XXX films used to be. Trippy! Casa is finding new ways to re-invent itself as not just a movie rental store but a place to have some delicious beers and take some home in a growler- eat some free popcorn- and buy movies too. And their website is awesome and you can order movies by mail. Casa is the last of its kind in Tucson and across America: a movie rental store. It should be treasured for what it is, because if we lose it, we're just going to Redbox. And Redbox doesn't have films obscure and old, or the amazing upstairs foreign/documentary section that is outstanding and one-of-a-kind;""]",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,15.0

It has great reviews online, we were there just as lunchtime is starting, it was very convenient and it smelled delicious! \n\nSt. Mary's tortilla factory is definitely a no fuss restaurant. You place your order at one window and pick it up at the next. All of the dishes are served in to go containers. It's your choice whether you take it to go or you pick out one of the tables inside to eat at. There are no waiters and you bus your own table. Nothing fancy just good food. Nice family friendly atmosphere, St Mary's Tortilla Factory is very welcoming and inviting, even to us out of towners! \n\nWith that said unless you are fan of extra spicy salsa (which I am not) you may want to take your order to go and use your own salsa at home. The spicy salsa fans in our little group had no problem with the house salsa that came complementary with lunch. But otherwise without any kind of salsa my food was just kind of dry. \n\nI ordered the lunch combo chicken taco and green corn tamale. It wasn't bad but it wasn't a meal that I would run back to repeat anytime soon. It was just so dry and kind of bland. The refried beans and rice however were very flavorful and very good! The fresh tortilla (wound around a popsicle stick and put into the plastic bag to preserve freshness,) was very good too. I can see why this place is popular with the locals and after traveling all morning - the food was exactly what we needed and really hit the spot.\n\nWhile others in our little party loved their lunch and bookmarked the place with plans to return soon - my favorite part of the meal was excellent lemonade! It was so cool and refreshing, tart and sweet but not overly so - I would definitely stop in again for another cup! \n\nThe service was fast and very efficient. The restaurant is kind of small but seems just right for an operation that offers take out as well as dine-in, and during the time we sat eating I saw plenty of people stopping in for both. Lots of open free parking, St Mary's Tortilla Factory is very easy to get to and by noon there was a line out the door for food orders! So get there early!"", ""Carne Seca! There are very few places that do Carne Seca, which is sun dried beef.  Here, at St. Mary's Tortilla Factory, you can have carne seca with fresh home made tortillas. It's a double win!! \n\nWe came in for the breakfast burritos which had carne seca rolled up in a homemade flour tortilla, along with potatoes and eggs. It was super noms! St Mary's Tortilla Factory offer up hearty, affordable, breakfast options that represents some of the best regional stuff Tucson has to offer."", ""I hang my hat in San Francisco now, but when I Iived in Tucson, I went to St. Mary's all the time. The shit is goood. Like two-syllable good.\r\n\r\nTortillas are meant to be fried. I can only think of one place in San Francisco that fries their tortillas, and that's Chavo's at 4th and Bryant. All the other places use steam presses - something better reserved for laundry service. Even with the frying, Chavo's is only so-so. Nothing beats El Farolito in this city. But I digress. Back to Tucson...\r\n\r\nSt. Mary's takes the art of the tortilla a few steps further by making them all by hand, daily. They melt in your mouth. They're probably full of lard. If that's the secret, then God bless lard.\r\n\r\nSt. Mary's is exactly the kind of hole-in-the-wall joint I love. Unpretentious as a crosstown bus. Sometimes the service is friendly. Sometimes you get the stink eye. Sometimes it's speedy. Sometimes glacial.\r\n\r\nEverything on the menu is delicious, but my favorite is to go early enough for the breakfast burritos. Tucson chorizo is spicy as hell, so I usually take mine without. Unless I'm hungover. Then definitely with. \r\n\r\nEven when I was so full I could barely stand, I never left the place without buying a dozen bag of tortillas. Or sometimes gorditas - smaller and thicker.\r\n\r\nMan I miss that place.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0

It was about a 45-60 minutes drive in the bus and a little wait to get on the pontoon.  However, it was a great tour.  Our tour guide on the boat was fun and informative and he let us all hold a baby alligator.  He got alligators to come near the boat by feeding them marshmallows.  Who knew?!  Alligators like marshmallows!\n\nOur Cemetary Tour was led by Bill, who happened to be a new anchor in town.  He led a very informative tour on the way and in the cemetery.  He had some great recommendations.  We did get to see Marie Laveau\'s grave and Nicholas Cage\'s as well.  The history of the cemetery is fascinating also.  ""Saved by the Bell"" was coined in New Orleans in the cemetery.  They used to tie a bell to the limb of someone who had passed from yellow fever and leave someone on duty after they were buried to be sure they didn\'t wake up.  Apparently, this happened often with yellow fever victims. \n\nOur Haunted Walking Tour was led by Billie Jo.  She was such a fun tour guide.  She was excited and had so much energy.

The cuisine from El Cucuy references the Mexican flavors and cuisine one will find when visiting cities and towns in Mexico alongside the Texas border. \n\nThere is a distinct cuisine of Mexican cuisine one will acknowledge and even understand as Mexican dishes served in Mexican towns alongside the Cali-Mexico Border and New Mexico-Mexico Border are way different than Mexican towns in Tex-Mexico Border. Don\'t believe me... just ask a Californian, New Mexican, and a Texan what type of bread and beverage should be served with menudo and you\'ll see a foodie argument escalate so quickly. Now add that Texas spans about 16 hours across and even regions within Texas differ slightly ie El Paso/Ciudad Juárez and The Valley/Mexico and you have a full blown Hunger Games discussion.\n\n////\n\nBringing it back to El Cucuy now these dishes are not meant to be served in a plated way or feature ingredients one may be accustomed to when eating Mexican food in New Orleans. The flavors are way different and seasonings are a bit more intense, in a good way of course.\n\nOf course, El Cucuy has some items that although are still delicious it\'s just not the particular style of serving I\'m used to. This goes for their queso, but hey I\'m not complaining, queso recipes are a family heirloom (I\'m dead serious) and I can definitely recognize this recipe had the touch of an Abuela\'s influence. I just prefer the Abuela\'s in El Paso, San Antonio, and Ciudad Juarez if that makes sense.\n\nNow for their tacos and elote, DAMNNNNNNN, just take my money every time because I love it. Is it a bit pricier that I\'ve paid for in Mexico, sure, but I also was eating them off a street cart in Ciudad Juarez and not on Tchoup. Street where I\'m sure their lease alone is stupid expensive. \n\nMenu prices account for location due to retail space and monthly leasing, etc. It\'s a business y\'all not your friends house...\n\nI love making their tacos ""cruda"" which is a fried Chihuahua cheese layer within your taco. It\'s like a little love letter to home and my childhood. The Elote is delicious and I appreciate the proper toppings they use. \n\n*Secretly crossing my fingers they one day do an ""elote en vaso"" for their menu. \n\nTheir tacos when ordered have the protein mixed with a paired in-house salsa. If you\'re not one for salsa, simply ask for them to make it dry or to include the salsa on the side. Btw their asada and trompo are delish and the al pastor has pineapple in it. (I\'m curious if maybe they added the pineapple recently since earlier reviews?)\n\nChips and salsa are bomb btw! I haven\'t tried their whole menu so can\'t speak for everything else.\n\n//\n\nMost likely COVID-19 Related:\nIt\'s quite easy to order although the logistics on a busier day isn\'t as ideal. You go up the stairs, place your order at the door, receive a number, and then you find a table. If all the tables are full though, you kinda just wait in a ""queued line"" alongside the house until one opens up. Hopefully this changes once you can actually dine inside post-pandemic.\n\n//\n\nAs for the 20% automatic gratuity...\n\nEveryone needs to understand that eating out is a form of art and you\'re paying for the luxury to have a team cook for you, serve you, tend to you, and clean up after you. I personally think all restaurants when dining in should require a minimum of 18-20% gratuity because sadly folks as a whole don\'t tip properly. If your food was served or delivered wrong you should bring it up immediately to the team or staff, it\'s not the servers fault if the kitchen does it incorrectly. You can\'t put 100% of the blame on them. Also just so folks understands tips from servers almost always gets shared with so many other roles in the restaurant as a thank you. \n\nYou\'re not just tipping your server you\'re providing a livelihood to the server, host, bartenders, bar keep, dishwashers, kitchen line, cleaning crew, etc...\n\nEating at a restaurant is an experience and a service and is something that is not a requirement in life. Everyone is more than welcome to pick up ingredients and cook/eat at home. Your meals don\'t just magically whip up in twenty minutes there\'s a full production that happens behind the scenes the day of, even a week or two in advance with marinating, food prep, etc.\n\n//\n\nMaybe my one and only recommendation for El Cucuy Team is to just have a sign clearly stated at the stairs ""We Charge An Automatic 20% Gratuity To Support Our Staff & Their Livelihood"" so if folks aren\'t in agreeance then they can leave without ever stepping foot.', 'In the words of Omar little ""if you come at the king (in this case it\'s neighbor barracuda) you best not miss."" While the margs def didn\'t miss and neither did the eloté. the tacos did and they weren\'t even comparable. Barracuda has better tacos by not even a mile, 20 miles at least. Everything was Overpriced as well. The euros were just overpriced and Overhyped Doritos. They added a 20% gratitude fee which for a self sit place is Ludacris to me. to go along with all of this the steak in the tacos were very dry. If you want tacos and a fairly priced meal barracuda still reigns as king. While also in all honestly is on a whole other level.\n\n43 dollars for 2 subpar/ below average tacos, marg, glorified Doritos and eloté is criminal/ borderline robbery. This all is coming from a New Yorker.', ""Uhh. What am I missing here? If you can't get the tacos right then you might as well shut down. The tiny dollop of chicken or carne asada on each taco was tough and dry. I ordered all the toppings which amounted to a barely perceptible sprinkling of cheese, onions and a fleck of cilantro. There are two places making loaded, scrumptious tacos nearby: barracuda and liberacion. You'd probably find higher quality at Chipotle and avoid paying $15 for three pitiful excuses for tacos. Also, the owner's snarky, immature responses to legitimate criticisms in other reviews really leaves me with zero guilt here.

My family is from Jamaica and we use a lot of rosewater in our desserts. They had never done this before but were willing to try. My fiance took over the rosewater he wanted to be used and left it in their hands. I was so surprised at how delicious it was. I think I must have had close to 10 pieces of cake that weekend. It was sooo delicious and extremely moist. The icing was vanilla buttercream and was to die for. Thank you Village Bakehouse"", ""Searching for a cake? Add Village Bakehouse to your list. They can do almost anything you could imagine even on short notice. We ordered a Boston cream cake for a birthday the day before and they hooked us up. The cake was perfect and there were no leftovers! Village Bakehouse is TUCSON classic. That I hope more people will continue to support and discover. If you're not in the market for a cake they have all kinds of other pastries, breakfast and lunch.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

It ended up being a great choice. My check in process was quick and painless with no issues. Lobby is decorated nicely. There is a large breakfast area with plenty of seating off the Lobby check in. I didn't use the 1st day but tried the 2nd day. I arrived right at the time of closing, but they kept it open for me, so I could eat. Plenty of warm and cold options, Eggs, Sausage, Waffles, Yogurts, fresh fruit, Juices., Toast, Etc. Not bad! My Room was very nice, extremely comfortable, the Air conditioner worked great, the water pressure in the shower was like a fire hose, I can't complain, Day 1 there was a nearby Fiber Optic Cut that took the Internet down at the hotel, so work stuff was problematic having to connect my Mobile phone to my Laptop. Not the Hotels fault so I can't really blame them, but more of an inconvenience. The staff handled my frustration well and called me several times to provide updates. They even called me when the outage was fixed to have me check if it was working. The Hotel has an outdoor pool, small Gym and a business center from what I could see but I didn't use these amenities. Overall the Hotel is nice, clean, and all the staff I interacted with were very professional. Plus, the rate is very reasonable. A winner."", 'I needed a quick getaway from Miami, so I decided to go visit my brother and few friends in Tampa. High prices around spring break season, led me to look at ""2 star"" hotels on various travel sites. How Springhill Suites can be in the same category as some of the other 2 star hotels in the area is crazy to me. My experience staying there exceeded my expectations. \n\nThe location: SHS is tucked away in Tampa Palms, and even though reviews on Trip Advisor complained about it being close to the highway, I didn\'t have any noise issues. You really don\'t feel like you\'re near the highway. It\'s secluded, but less than a 5 minute drive from restaurants, a CVS, shopping plazas, etc. \n\nThe hotel: There is plenty of parking out front. The hotel has a modern feel inside, plenty of seating for their complimentary breakfast, an business center off the lobby, and a pool. All of the employees are friendly, and they even remembered my name when I saw them on my second day there. As far as housekeeping, there\'s a little card on the desk when you check in that says you should ask them if you need anything during your stay. I think because it\'s ""suite"" style, they may not do the rounds as often as some other hotels, and they\'re like a hotel/extended stay hybrid maybe? Whatever the case is, I asked them the morning of day 2 if they could replace the towels, and they ended up cleaning the whole room (replaced cups, new towels, made the bed, etc.). Just ask! That\'s something you just don\'t get at a ""2 star"" hotel. I haven\'t even experienced that at some hotels that are rated much higher. \n\nThe room: My hotel room was huge. Most small, dumpy hotels in the area were charging $90-140 a night for this particular weekend, and this huge room at SHS was $126. I felt like I got such a bargain. My room had a couch, desk, and chair that was sort of separated from the bedroom area by  partition above the desk. There was also a small area with a counter space for the coffee maker and ice bucket, with a mini fridge below and microwave above. Passing the partition, there was a hug king size bed, large flatscreen tv, a modern armoirer, and a slatted bench next to the window (presumably a modern luggage rack). There was also a divided bathroom. There was a toilet and sink behind a sliding door with frosted glass, and then the main part of the bathroom with the sink, large mirror, and shower behind the same kind of sliding door. Some of the rooms also have bathtubs, but they were all occupied by the time I checked in. My only wish was that there was a dresser (the tv stand only had one drawer) or a larger armoirer. It was just me, but I can imagine that families would need to get ready out of their suitcase because there isn\'t much space to hang clothes or put things in drawers. \n\nOverall: Way better value than many hotels in this area,and definitely deserves more than 2 stars on these hotel site search engines.', ""My family of four had a nice stay here. It is about 20 minutes to Busch Gardens. The room was clean and comfortable. The pool area was ok. The water was a bit chilly, so it would have been nice if it had been heated. There also weren't any pool towels available, and no jacuzzi either. We grabbed a couple of hand towels that I think were meant for the gym... but they were mediocre. The complimentary buffet breakfast was decent. It was the usual assortment of various breads, cereals, yogurt, waffle maker, and two hot items. The front desk staff were polite. While I wasn't wowed with anything, it was a clean and comfortable stay with everything we needed so we would have no objection staying again.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,30.0

Framed pinups coyly look down from the walls at the crowd of seasoned regulars and newbies who knew someone who knew someone to find this little neighborhood spot. \n\nGo there to watch a Saints game on a lazy Sunday or to catch up with an old friend, maybe make new ones. Riffraff are kept out by a door buzzer, and the bar makes sure to respect their neighbors by keeping things low-key.\n\nThe staff is wonderful.

A handful of their bartenders have been there since I started going, and make the most amazing drinks. This is where the ""dive"" part really comes into question. Their cocktails are the tits. When I think dive bar, I know I\'m going to have to order a two-ingredient drink, ie whiskey and Diet. No sir, not here. Last night, Charley, the sweetest bartender ever, made me probably the best Bloody Mary I\'ve had all year, at 9:30pm. I call that Dinner. And it was done with a sure thing, and a coming right up. I\'ve literally been told flat out ""no"" by other bars when I try to order a Bloody after 5pm. I always ask though and have a backup order. I needed that Bloody and Charley knew it while working an entire bar of 20+ folks with style and grace. My mind is literally boggled at this wizardry of bartending. \n\nAlso, every time I close out, I can\'t believe how affordable drinks are ( back to dive bar prices ). I feel like I\'m robbing the place and always try to make sure to tip really really well. What\'s also nice is if you run up a cheap bar tab and need to soak up all those tasty drinks in your belly, they nearly always have a food pop-up that\'s damn delicious.

Whatever it is, it's just unappealing. Again with the 70s. Or maybe that's the 80s. Either way, I must be the wrong demographic b/c I definitely have no interest in seeing Burt Reyond's wang. Come to think of it, I may be blocking it out, but his wang might not even be visible. That thick carpet of chest hair, OTOH... Mondo trauma. \n+I love the curved staircase leading up to the ladies.

Pralines (pronounced ""prah-lines"") are a big part of the city and everyone is going to claim that they make the best ones.\n\nWell, Southern Candymakers was no exception clearly highlighting their accolades in the window. What really drew us in was, well, #1 they were on our way to dinner and they were making them as we walked by. You could smell the butter and sugar a block away and it beckoned you in. Whenever you go to a shop like this, take advantage of the fact that most places will offer you a try. Take a moment to taste the treat and you\'ll begin to notice subtle differences. You may not be able to name what exactly is different but each place is truly unique with their praline recipe.\n\nI decided to go with a mix. They had a chocolate, lemon, rum, peanut and ""creamy"" (I believe this is technically the standard praline). You tell them what size box you want and they can fill it up. The creamy and the lemon were my favorite and they traveled well. They can package it up for you to easily be packed into a suitcase and onto the plane. \n\nWhile no one particular praline place stands out as my favorite, Southern Candymaker definitely makes a good one.

I had attempted to take a picture of the making candy, and was politely asked to not take any pictures. #MyBadThereWeren'tAnySigns\n\nWe were finally offered a small little sample, and it truly was nothing to write home about, and definitely paled in comparison to some of the other pralines that we tried.\n\nThere are plenty of places/candy stores to try in and around the area. I would not put this one on your to go to list"", ""The amazing aroma of chocolate and candy will lead you into Southern Candy makers. I've must bought and sampled pralines from over a dozen places, and Southern candy makers is my favorite. The flavors I like most are original and peanut butter.

It used to be a loud gong but i think someone had a heart attack and they changed it. It\'s always packed with families, birthday and prom parties. \nThe atmosphere is very traditional hibachi grill restaurant: art on the walls, Fish tanks, and statues. They did add a faux rock entrance for the bar with a Koi pond on the bottom. Yes your crumb snatching kids can feed the fish, just ask the hostess for some food. The majority of the space is hibachi grills with seating wrapped around it, i think there is 10-12 and Each grill seats 10 guests. \nThe food is average for the most part, but the quality can vary depending on the Chef you get. It\'s a crap shoot as they move from station to station with a break for meal prep. Over the years things have been removed and added, i.e. no more ribeye is available, they removed the ""japanese A-1"" sauce as most folks go for the ""Yummy or yum-yum""sauce aka white sauce. It is a standard meal you get: Onion soup, Ginger salad, rice, noodles, and your protein or veggie for you herbivores. The meats are sirloin, teriyaki steak, chicken,shrimp,scallops,(new) Rare tuna, and Filet mignon. I might have missed something, i rarely peruse past my choice. There is combos available such as surf n turf and shrimp and scallops, also mushrooms is a popular add-on.\nThe king of all the meals is the Kobe steak or imperial meal. The cows are pampered and massaged and get the royal treatment in Japan which is where it\'s imported from. I have had the Kobe beef in the past and it is amazing, soft flavorful and delicious. That was back in the days when it was $68, now the meal will set you back $90 but includes a lobster tail.\nI\'ve had great Kobe meals and mediocre meals and i always feel like a tourist when they make the onion volcano and set it on fire. The  vast majority of meals were good, as fresh food cooked while you watch is a great idea. \nPrices these days range from $18-90 depending on what protein you desire.

The decor is amazing and the skill of our Japanese chef was on point. He caught vegetables and eggs in his hat, pockets, and behind the back. Our chef was very quick and efficient with his knife work too. They do a great birthday and anniversary song and dance with some cool Japanese drums that produces nice tone.

The folks at the restaurant must have sensed that we were going to be a wild & crazy group as they put us in one of the back dining rooms and assigned a top-notch showman / chef to keep us entertained.\n\nFor those who've not been to Kobe before, this is a Teppanyaki or Hibachi cooking restaurant. You are seated on three sides of an open flat-top grill, and you interact with the chef as they prepare succulent steak, chicken, and seafood dishes according to the ancient Hibachi style of food preparation. Each chef brings their own sense of humor and spontaneity to the table, and all entrees are prepared in a display of flashing knives and exotic aromas.\n\nMost of us ordered a Japanese beer to start while we perused the menu. Each Teppanyaki entrée came with Japanese clear onion soup, crisp green salad with miso dressing, freshly-grilled oriental vegetables, grilled noodles, and fried rice. Several of us ordered sushi rolls and Gyoza dumplings as appetizers, and those were passed around and quickly devoured. \n\nFor our main course, we had our choice of any of the following, or combinations of the following: Sirloin steak, Filet Mignon, center-cut NY Strip steak, chicken breasts, shrimp, Maine lobster, sea scallops, wild salmon, or wagyu beef. I opted for the Surf n' Turf special of a Filet and shrimp. First up were the soups and salads while we waited for the grill to reach optimal temperature and our chef to arrive.\n\nAfter cleaning and oiling the grill, our chef started by mixing up individual containers of the two different sauces which were set down in front of each of us -- a seasoned mustard mayo sauce for seafood and veggies, and a brown sauce for meats. And then the fun started.... the chef was busy grilling up the veggies and the rice while dazzling us with the clanging of his spatula, rapping of the pepper mill, and amazing knife skills. We've all heard the jokes before, but this guy was quite good, and we thoroughly enjoyed playing along as he spun the egg on the grill before flipping it up and balancing it on his spatula. A couple of quick Hai, Hai, Hai's and the egg was cracked into the pile of rice, and mixed up.\n\nHe did the amazing Veg-o-Matic trick with his knife and diced the veggies before our eyes. Next came the volcano made of onion slices (Ooooooo, Ahhhhhhh!), before the chef started flipping pieces of cooked vegetables into our waiting mouths. Yes, I felt like a damned sea lion at Point Loma, CA waiting for my treat, but we were all laughing hysterically by this point. The chef sliced up all of the different proteins and started portioning everything out as he continued his masterful display of shifting things around on the grill while cracking jokes. Even though we've seen the trick hundreds of times before, we all cheered as he sliced the tail off the shrimp and flipped it up into his tall chef's hat. Hai!\n\nThe meal wasn't cheap, but it was a heck of a lot of fun, and the food was delicious. The entertainment value of our meal was priceless, and we gave our chef a standing ovation at the conclusion of his cooking repertoire. \n\nKobe is a great place for the entire family, and kids are very easily entertained by the whole thing. We saw another table celebrating a birthday for one of the young girls in their group. She was beaming from ear-to-ear as they dressed her in a chef's hat and served her a birthday dessert accompanied by singing and banging on the ceremonial gong.""]",0.25,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.0,1.0,30.0

First was a Yelp sponsored event. The $5.00 (small pitcher) before 5 is a definite pull for me. I tried the tomato soup this visit. Very good. Not like the milk based I grew up with back east.

My only criticism is the same Tuna w chips we ordered at the Yelp event was ""stuffed "" w tuna and piled high w chips. Not so today. Lots of bread and few chips to share. Likely to return for $5 before 5 and homemade soups.', ""I feel like Postino is where all the cool kids hang out.  I haven't really been out in the world eating at restaurants this past year, my family has been living the take out life, so it was a lovely place to venture out to for brunch!  I met some dear friends and we enjoyed the patio dining tremendously! Lots of shade from umbrellas, which is important in our sunny city. We shared plates of croque madame, seeded avocado toast, smoked salmon carpaccio, crispy fingerlings and of course bruschetta! I think the group favorite was the salmon carpaccio but my favorite was the ricotta, dates and pistachio bruschetta. They also have lovely $5 mimosas! I was also obsessed with their iced tea. Good service, great music playing and overall good vibes at Postino! Be prepared for a busy parking lot, I felt fortunate to find a spot. It's a hip corner of Tucson at Grant & Tucson Blvd. Brunch is offered Saturday and Sunday starting at 9am and my recommendation would be to go early, as they don't take reservations."", ""I admit, I have never gone to a bruschetta place before. This was also my first time dining in since the pandemic started. When we went, it was around 7:00 p.m., and it was busy. We weren't able to find parking in the lot, so had to park across the street and walk over. Not too bad considering it was a beautiful day in terms of weather. For a table of three, we only had to wait about 15 minutes, despite it looking so busy. I feel like if you have a larger group, it would be much harder to get seating. \n\nThe atmosphere was excellent; the overhead music was a little louder than I would prefer, but otherwise it was a more intimate atmosphere than somewhere like culinary dropout across the street (which is the usual choice for louder, larger groups). \n\nIn terms of alcohol, they mainly had beers and wines, which was a bit tough on me since I am more of a mixed drink person. However, I was able to choose a pretty mellow wine, which suited my taste. \n\nFor the food menu, you'll have to scan a QR code on the drinks menu to view it, rather than a physical menu (or browse on Yelp haha). In terms of the bruschetta, I actually could not choose only four options, since they all sounded so good. I asked our server for recommendations, and took their first four picks. They included: \n- the sweet and spicy pepper jam with goat cheese (mainly sweet, with mild spice in the back of the throat)\n- the warm artichoke\n-the apple and brie fig (the contrast of the crunch of the apple was great)\n-  the smoked salmon and pesto\n\nAll were excellent. I really love places that give a sort of sampler platter style since I usually want to just try multiple things on the menu, but I'm limited by how much I can stuff in my stomach.\n\nTl;dr: This is an excellent place to go for smaller groups to enjoy a light meal or foods with some alcohol (though no hard liquor options). I would certainly come back, for multiple reasons, but especially for the bruschetta.""]",0.6,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.0,1.0,30.0

Safelite is now responsible for the estimated $1000.00 bodywork plus my rental car for the week that my car is going to be in the body shop. I did not notice the body damage until the next day since I was not at home when they went out to repair the window. I contacted Safelite's executive team, who then had Michelle call me from the local Safelite shop and she acted like she hadn't already been informed of what happened. I had to explain the whole story to her and not once did she say sorry on behalf of Safelite. She placed me on hold and came back to tell me that since I was not home at the time their tech was repairing my window, I was not able to sign the pre inspection paper on my car.(I have a brand new 2013 car that had no prior damage and the tech knew someone else was home if he needed anything) Michelle was very rude and not understanding of the situation. I proceeded to ask for the manager and go figure he was off work till the following week. My entire experience with Safelite has been a complete NIGHTMARE. On top of all this, the representatives who I called to schedule my appointment got the service address completely wrong multiple times and I had to call back to fix it. When I asked about the tinting on the window  the representative gave me false information that they would tint the window before installing it (Safelite doesn't do window tinting at all.) I would highly recommend finding another auto glass company for your window needs."", 'Got referred to Safelite by my insurance company and at first glance, everything was great. Came to my work and replaced my windshield, all was perfect... Or so I thought. A couple days later I noticed that my windshield wipers were completely gone. Not even just the blades, the whole assembly. I called Safelite the next day to ask them about it and was referred back to the guy who did it (Israel) who then proceeded to call me and ask ""so what\'s the problem?"". I told him he needed to replace them or put them back if he had them and he said he\'d come out later. He arrived an immediately asked for my keys which I completely did not understand because he had no reason to look in my car. He then looked under the hood and told me that someone must have stolen them from me because he put them back. After arguing in the parking lot for five minutes he threw his hands in the hair and drove away. Five minutes later he came back to put the drivers side wiper on (the wrong one mind you) ""in case I had to drive"" and told me he\'d order a new part. Then by some unknown miracle, he came back sometime later without my knowledge and replaced both my windshield wipers with the correct fittings and all. Would not recommend at all due to the rudeness of the technician. Israel needs to be fired.', 'Exceptional Quality and Customer Service\n\nThis review is for the Ina Road, Tucson, AZ store.- Over the years, I have had 3 windshields replaced at this facility (yes, even the Corvette one time). Each time I have used their services, I have been impressed with the quality and speed of their work. Today, I stopped-by because the rear view mirror on one of my older vehicles fell off the inside of the windshield owing to years of intense Arizona heat exposure. Not only did they have me out the door within 25 minutes of my arrival, they refused any payment for the work they performed for me. Now, where else these days would that happen? In addition, the technician was extremely polite and courteous as has always been the case at each of my visits.\n\nThe bottom line is these folks are a class act. They do the job right the first time and they treat their customers with the utmost respect. With me, they have a customer for life. I HIGHLY recommend this Safelite auto glass facility.

The line to order was about 10 minutes long and getting through the line and adding all the options took another 5 minutes. The serving size didn't look that big but ended up being very tasty and surprisingly filling. The ingredients were all very fresh and tasty. While the kale noodles are a novel concept, I still prefer the traditional sushi grade rice with my poke bowls because it absorbs the flavors of the sauce better and creates a more savory meal in my opinion. It was nice that staff asked if patrons wanted light, regular, or large portions of sauce with their poke bowl and mixed it in a separate bowl before putting it into the bowls.  I like my poke bowl saucy so I got a lot of sauce and it really hit the spot!

Cassie, TeBella\'s Director of Marketing and Social Media, was such a joy to deal with. \n\nWhat made my first time even better in TeBella was that fact there was also cheese! And with this cheese came Cheese Please\'s Michael, one of my favorite local store owners! But that, I shall save for my Cheese Please review! \n\nThere were about forty people here for this tasting and it was packed. Abigail was such a gracious host with her wealth of knowledge of teas. \n\nAll the teas were delicious. My favorite was the Bao Zhong Superior. Yah yah...enough of the ""because it\'s Asian jokes."" This tea was so delicious and it was paired with a Bleu Cheese, the Blue D\' Auvergne. This was the tea I decided to order to take a piece of this shop home with me.\n\nTeBella also sells pastries from Piquant, Chocolate Pi (*SIGH*), and other various Tampa retailers in their store. There is something for everyone here and a great place to buy gifts for a friend or two.\n\nThis tasting was a great event. TeBella holds monthly events that I look forward to attending in the future. I think my new goal is to try every single tea they have on their wall. I HIGHLY recommend this place and I will definitely be back, probably as soon as tomorrow...', ""This is located on a busy strip of Davis Island. This place reminds me of Teavana. It's basically the same concept where they have a bunch of pricey tea related gifts out front and many varieties of tea combos behind the counter. They provide you with a menu book/binder to review and help you with your choice. You can customize your own as you please and also order these teas to be brewed and drink right away. As mentioned before, they have a lot of cute items for sale that are a little bit on the pricey side, but good for a gifting if you know anyone into this. \n\nThey also have a café version of this place in the Oxford Exchange.

The green and red house made sauces are very flavorful and compliment the burritos well. The sauces remind me of the sauces at taco bus but better!  So it's no surprise that TacoSon is a creation of the original cook from Taco Bus!

If it's your first time waxing or you have sensitive skin like me, I would recommend here because of the special formula wax - very very little redness or irritation afterwards. They only use one application stick to keep everything sanitary, which is essential for any wax salon. \n\nCasting call: calling all young beautiful women from South Tampa who think they are too school for cool. Seriously, that must be how they recruit employees. I felt like an outsider entering a sorority house. No one told me When I booked the appt that I needed my resting b*tch face on when I came in! I walked in and said 'Hi!' The dry response, 'do you have an appointment?' Okay so no warm fuzzy friendliness here. I'm used to my other salon where they are very down-to-earth friendly girls. If you don't care about super friendliness then this place is very professional and you will like it.\n\nThe salon itself is very modern chic and clean. Parking is easy which is nice - it's in a tiny shopping center so no hassles there. I like not having to bother with street parking or paid parking.\n\nAnd I will be back because they do have some great packages and decent prices, I'll just remember to wear my resting b*tch face next time."", ""European Wax Center made me a believer. I never thought I'd be a frequent waxer after a bad public bleeding incident over 12 years ago. I always thought that someday I'd get laser hair removal. I still may do it, but for now waxing has made my situation a lot smoother.\n\nSo, I was an everyday shaver. I'm talking completely bald Brazilian (every day) and under arms (every single day). I scar easily and dark. So since shaving is like having a million cuts the pigmentation under my arms was darker than the rest of my body. You can imagine how course the hair had to be with me shaving daily. \n\nAfter 8 months of waxing my skin has healed. My underarm area has lightened. The hair on the Brazilian and under arms are so fine and soft that sometimes I don't even realize I have hair present.\n\nSo, I bought an unlimited underarm package and the 9 pack for the Brazilian (I think it turned out to be 11 with a special Euro was running. It has been well with it for me. My next visit is in September and I'll have 1 more Brazilian left. I'll probably do the 9 pack again since hair grows slower in the winter months. Currently I'm going in every 3 weeks, bit when it was cooler I was going in every 4 weeks. My underarm package is good until February, I think and I'm sure I'll renew that too.\n\nThe only thing I didn't care for was the leg waxing, which happens to be painless for me. My leg hairs don't grow in so fast, but after waxing it wasn't as smooth as shaving because the hairs seem to break over and not under the skin. Not so for softer areas like underarms where it seems the wax pulls from the root. Yes, Brazilian waxing hurts, but not as bad as other wax. Since Euro uses a hard wax (purple colored wax and no strips) it is much gentler on your skin.\n\nI was a chicken, but now I'm a frequent waxer. Nicole is my waxer and highly recommended."", ""Great about scheduling, always have packages & are wonderful in general.\n\nCourteous, they call days ahead of your appointment to confirm.

After kicking out my favorite wing joint, I just had to see if it was worth it..\n\nThey remodeled the store, adding central air conditioning, painting the walls, making the entrance ""prettier,"" decorating the walls with classic car paraphernalia, and most importantly, cleaning the bathroom.  They have new chairs and shiny new tables.\n\nThe front of the store has a neon lit sign that says 76.  Nowhere that I can find does it say PJ Subs other than on the front of the menu.  So really, I don\'t know what this place is called.  After hours of deliberation with my friend\'s roommate, we came to the conclusion that the ""76"" is actually a ""T6,"" which would stand for Tucson and 6th, the location of this sub joint.\n\nTheir menu consists of subs (cold or hot, from $5-8) and sides.  In addition they have salads and wings.  The bread is baked fresh, the vegetables are fresh, and the meats and cheeses are high quality.\n\nMy favorite is ""The Regular"" which has salami, capicolla, provolone, and the standard lettuce/tomato/onion.  They also put oil/vinegar on it and I asked for mayo (no charge).  It was presented open faced and looked very appetizing.  I could taste the quality in the meats and this was not as greasy as Silvermine or Jimmy John\'s version of the same sandwich.  Most of the cold sandwiches are a different combination of the same meats and cheeses, I\'ve tried all of them and can\'t distinguish a huge difference in any of them.\n\nThe wings are alright, good enough to validate eating fried fat but not good enough to eat them alone as a meal.  The garlic bread is another item to miss.\n\nPJ\'s officially opened on Monday, 1/5, and are still under construction.

It is becoming my go-to sammich when I order, followed closely by the Chizzo (Italian sauage with peppers and onions).  We recently discovered that they deliver to my home, which is awesome for when I'm studying and have no food in the house.\n\nThe people who take my order are always courteous, and the people who deliver are very kind and are quick to crack jokes with you.  The delivery service here is awesome!  I never have to wait too long, and everything makes it to my front door before the bread gets soggy and gross.\n\nSo, as mentioned previously, the tuna is where it's at.  There is no relish in their tuna, thank goodness, it's just delicious.  No nonsense, just tuna the way the tuna gods intended.  The Chizzo is really good, but there are sometimes when it's just too spicy for me (keep in mind, I'm a big wimp...so it's probably fine for any normal person).  The husband gets the meat ball sub, which I normally do not care for, but this one is incredible!  The bread is perfect, the sauce is tangy, the cheese is all melty, the balls are all meaty....yum...\n\nAnd the sides!  Let me tell you!  The fried zucchini are something to behold.  They are crispy, and they aren't all breading with a tiny sliver of zucchini.  In fact, they are just the opposite!  The mushroom are the same, though they can be a little hit or miss....sometimes they have been left out for too long and are squishy, sometimes they weren't in the fryer for long enough and are almost all raw, and sometimes they are the picture of the perfect fried shroom.  Their ranch...dear lord...their ranch...it is delicious and the perfect consistency...yes, their ranch is some of the best I've had.\n\nThe good news is, I don't live particularly close, and they still deliver in a reasonable time and for a very reasonable price.  I will order them again.  And again.  And again."", 'Let me tell you all about my best friend, PJ\'s Subs. \n\nSometimes you have a day in which everything goes wrong, and you\'ve been working all day and you\'re tired and you\'re hungry and all you want in the whole world is something deep fried and covered in cheese.\n\nBut you don\'t want to cook.\n\nAnd you don\'t want to go out. You can barely muster the strength to get up out of bed.\n\nYou certainly don\'t want to do anything foolish like talk on the phone, because you\'ve been talking on the phone all day and if one more person tells you something that you ""should"" or ""need"" to do you might just scream and scream and never stop screaming. \n\nThis is why PJ\'s Subs is your friend. Because they have what you want. And if you\'re lucky enough to live in the magical area of Tucson to which they deliver -- they will bring you what you want. And you can order online. \n\nOrder. Online. \n\nSo you crawl to your computer (or, if you are lucky, you have a laptop and you don\'t have to get out of bed at all) and you pull up their website. You mash buttons furiously, coming up with the most calorie-laden, cheese-covered, heart-stopping monstrosity you can find. Do I want ranch with that? HELL YES I WANT RANCH WITH THAT. Small fries? Why is that even on the menu? The way to true nirvana is only through large fries. \n\nSo you order. And you give the numbers off of your money card to the machine and you wait while the light blinks and then it tells you ""your order has been received"" and it estimates you at a time at which it will be ready (and if you\'re like me you\'ve done this 30 minutes before close and you\'re praying that the staff doesn\'t hate you and you pull out extra dollars to give to them in apology). \n\nAnd then you wait. \n\nSometimes you lay back and you watch TV and you forget. You\'re hungry but the blinking light in your mind that says ""EAT NOW"" has turned off or at least is just a steady red ""HUNGRY"". Your lizard brain knows that something will come. Something will come and it will take away the pain of the horrible day that you just had. At this point you can barely remember what you ordered but you know that out there in the black night there is a man (or a woman I don\'t know) and that man is a saint because he is making food for you in a kitchen and then he is going to BRING THAT FOOD TO YOU. \n\nAnd then the doorbell rings. It sounds like choir of angels singing heavenly praises except they are just saying ""FOOOOOD"". And you pay the man and try not to weep and you take the food and then I don\'t know what you do with it. Maybe you just look at it for a while. Or maybe you just bury your face in the bag like a horse. Or maybe you just unhinge your jaw like a snake and swallow the bag (or bags) whole. Or maybe you are a weirdo and you empty the bag onto a ""plate"" and then you use ""a fork"" to eat it. Whatever you do in the privacy of your own home, man.\n\nI recommend the double philly cheesesteak (cheese sauce forever) or the french dip. I also highly recommend that you order the large fries because the small fries are never enough to fill the emptiness inside of you. But the large fries might.

They are just amazing, and juicy, and they have a zillion of them, and all of them are amazing.  My personal favorite is the San Francisco, which is on sourdough bread with lettuce, onions, tomatoes and Thousand Island dressing.  It\'s amazing.  (Yes.  I know a used the word ""amazing"" a lot for this burger, but that\'s what it is...so there).\n\nSo, onto the service, which really is what made this road to loving this place to damn horrible.  I really wanted to like this place.  The food is awesome, the atmosphere is fun and very neighborhood-bar-y.  But the service, until we had Amy as a server, was hideous.  Servers were super rude, our drinks never got refilled, one of them took a LOT of sass with my brother who had just gotten home from being deployed (that one had me really upset).\n\nThen we met Amy, the shining beam of freaking sunlight.

There are pool tables in the back and TVs (various sizes) everywhere so I can imagine this is a great place to watch games. College football was playing when I went. \n\nThe food was surprisingly good. My burger was delicious and LOADED with green chilies, cheese, bacon, and sauteed onions.

The menu is extensive which caused me some trepidation, when a place focuses on too many items, my experience is the food suffers (Think Cheesecake Factory)  I had the fries (perfectly cooked), then the cheeseburger with onion rings (Again perfectly prepared) - 5 stars.

So, I'm picky when it comes to Dominican food. For the items I don't cook or if I am too lazy, I hope for a great restaurant with decent prices to fill in where I lack the skills (or the time to figure it out). There was a convenience store on Waters that served Dominican fare, but it got bought out by who we assume is a non-Dominican Hispanic. El Tipico so far is the closest Dominican spot to my home that can fill that void.\n\nI had the chivo guisado (goat), mangu, rice and beans and avocado salad. All of it delicious. Only reason this doesn't get a 5 star is because I now rate every Domincan restaurant against Mangu Cafe and it was like Mangu Cafe was adding a bit of crack to everything because it was out of this world good! El Tipico is a solid choice, however. It's also better than all the Dominican restaurants I've tried in the Town and Country area.\n\nOrdering is easy because all the food is laid out on a line in front of you, so you can see what everything looks like.

The first, obviously, was a Cuban sandwich and I found it to be up there with some of the best in town.

Their roasted pork here is really good, and if wasn\'t for that, their Cuban would rank a lot lower for me.  Why?  Because they use boiled ham.  In this day and age, there\'s just no reason to ever serve boiled lunch meat ham.  It\'s largely un-flavorful and only acts as a pink-colored filler on the sandwich.  There are other cost-effective hams that actually bring TASTE to a sandwich.  Also, they add lettuce and tomato by default.  While I like to break from tradition sometimes and add tomato, this is a no-no.  Still, not bad in a pinch.\n\nTheir ""Philly"" is a non-traditional version. Served on fresh Cuban bread with provolone cheese and slices of what appears to be skirt steak with caramelized peppers and onions?  Sounds like a real mash up, huh?  Perhaps they should just called it the ""Tampa Cheesesteak"" so as not to offend ""Philly"" purists.  Either way, the sandwich is good.  I might have enjoyed it more than the Cuban.\n\nAs for the name of the place, El Tipico, I think it\'s funny.

We heard the most horrendous noise which we thought that the springs on the door had broke off.  We had our 2 cars in the garage and could not get out.  So sadly  we were stuck in the house.  We were never happy with any garage door people so found ourselves at a loss as to who to call and would anyone answer the call on a Saturday at 4.30 PM.  Tried a few numbers.  No luck. One machine told us the hours Mon- to Fri. 9 to 4.  One guys said his employee had just quit and couldn\'t see us until Mon.  Ending the conversation with "" Now you have a wonderful weekend"".  Called Overhead Door Co. and immediately Art Alcon was on the phone and at his office on Drexel.  We live Swan and Sunrise.  He arrived by 5.00 PM while nursing a bad cold cheerfully took out his tools to replace our rollers, springs, repaired a bent garage door.  He knew exactly what he was doing,had all the correct tools and parts and worked very efficiently.  Oiled all the parts.  This is the only place to use.  Price seemed very fair and even honored the discount coupon we had in the yellow pages.  Great guy.  Before he came he had bought some soup to take to his wife and family who were also suffering from bad colds. By the time he finished the soup was cold.  I told him to microwave it and wished him and his family get better soon. I will always use Art  in the future for any garage door problem.', ""This is my second experience with Overhead Door. \nMy second home in Tucson, and they were recommended to me by my next door neighbor at the first house. \nThis time I bought a Tucson patio home from out of \nState.

I called them and Arthur answered the phone. I knew this should be something very simple to readjust or reset to make it working again. I tried to explain to him what happened and hoped he could give me few tips to try first before had him sent someone over.

I called Art back and told him that I fixed the problem and not so happy of his unwillingness to help over the phone. I am sure he knows how to fix this kind of problem if he can just listen to my explanation more closely.

I know that El Charro is a \nTucson institution but I will say (blast me if you will) I am not their biggest fan. That said, these guys really seem to know what they\'re doing and Charro Steak may have begin to change my opinion of the Flores group of restaurants.\n\nThe space is, well, let\'s call it rustic elegance. Lots of metal and stressed wood tables. They have two bars: one where you can wait for a table if you don\'t have a reservation (which we did) and one inside the restaurant. Maybe that\'s overkill but having the bar in front made the one inside more accessible to the servers. Although, in hindsight, the timing of the drinks was the only true hiccup in service.\n\nBefore I start to talk about the food, I\'ll mention that their menu is largely gluten free and it\'s noted next to the dish. I\'ll also mention that they really focus on local ingredients right down to the corn tortillas they use for chips. Their motto is ""ranch to table"". Not terribly original but it speaks to their meat focused theme.\n\nI ordered Monica\'s Martini. A standard vodka martini but was garnished with a bleu cheese olive and pork belly chicharron. It didn\'t show up to the table until after our albondigas appetizer. But those albondigas... served with charred Chiles, Manchego cheese and Prickly Pear barbecue sauce. The server mentioned the sauce was spicy so we asked for it on the side. I\'ll offer some totally unsolicited advice - they need to put a rib dish on the menu and serve it with that sweet, spicy and just plain tasty sauce. I\'d order it in a heartbeat.\n\nSince we had ordered the meatballs, we decided to split the boneless ribeye. It turned out to be enough, with the sides, but I\'d probably get my own steak next time. I\'d figured, since we were splitting the dish, the least they could do is bring me a plate and a steak knife. They brought one knife for my wife and me to share and I was left with a small plate meant for sides. That didn\'t deter me once the steak and sides arrived. The ribeye was probably closer to medium well, but that\'s fine with me. It came with a little cup of charro beans and their ""salsa padre"" which tasted eerily similar to A-1 with salsa. The steak hardly needed that sauce anyway.\n\nSometimes, in a steakhouse, the sides are where they can really shine... and Charro Steak does. We got the Esquites, charred corn with cotija cheese and crema and the Papas de la Casa, with crema and green chiles. They really did classic steakhouse sides justice putting a Charro spin on them. Both of them and the charro beans were really good and made me forget I was eating a steak on a plate meant for appetizers.\n\nWhen the dessert menu was presented and we saw Tamal de Nutella we looked at each other and knew we had to try it. Really creative and not too sweet, it was a good finish to our meal.\n\nI know I can be long winded in some reviews. I really try to give details because I know that\'s what I look for in reviews. So, if you\'re still reading, I\'ll either apologize or thank your for indulging me... you choose.\n\nService, for the most part,  was outstanding. A busser noticed our chips were kind of broken so he offered us some new ones. Plates were cleared and water refilled promptly. The only issues with service were the ones I mentioned and the fact that the wine we ordered with our steaks showed up a little late. Those kind of service boo boos are totally fixable and won\'t stop of from returning... soon.', ""Missing Charro steak big time. Our last order during Covid was a little complicated due to the time on their system not matching up with the website to place our online order. But that's nothing a quick phone call didn't fix!

They all work so hard!"", ""Charro Steak is my go to place, for out of town company. It's got a wonderful southwestern flare. The menu has something for everyone. It's got a rich vibrancy and the tall ceiling makes it feel even more grand. I've enjoyed many a Sunday brunch, lunch and dinner. I love the food and attention to detail the staff pay to the table. We have brought out of town business guests here many times, and every occasion El Charro Steak has exceeded our expectations. My husband loves their carne asada, estilo style( with roasted chiles and cheese). I am a big fan of their Sunday brunch, which is Sundays starting at 11am.\nIf you are going with a group, get the Tabla del Charro ( Charcuterie Board). I could just live on a cocktail and nibbles of the cheeses and offering that board provides....heaven!  At certain times they offer live music; a great delight which is often a classical guitar player. During brunch the music is just perfect for an al fresco meal experience, with the windows slid open along Broadway.\nOn holidays, check their website, as often they have special menus, which are cause to go see what tricks they have up their sleeve. Charro Steak frequently is the site of special wine paring dinners and fund raisers. If you need to arrange a special occasion party they can easily accommodate big groups. The restaurant is a very large area with multiple dinning areas, two bar areas and semi private walled area. The only down side is with all this space, the restaurant just has three single stall restrooms for the entire place, even though there are two bar areas. Once I was attending a wine paring dinner, and had to wait 10 minutes for the stall, since someone was doing their makeup or texting in the restroom or who knows....I don't know how I held it. I have since learned there is a single unisex stall in the bar area of the entrance. There is also a outdoor patio area, but I haven't sat outside for a meal yet.\nFor a great meal, with outstanding atmosphere and service, don't miss the chance to hit up this gem off Broadway!""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,50.0

I've seen the Abita Beer sauce used in dishes elsewhere around town and it seems to be a local favorite.\n\nThe brunch cocktails include Bloody Mary's, Brandy Milk Punch, Sazerac, Ramos Gin Fizz and an Absinthe concoction.\n\nIt's worth taking a stroll around the restaurant to check out the many rooms and nooks and crannies.  Other areas include an outdoor balcony, an indoor courtyard bar area and The Seance room where the resident ghost of Pierre Antoine Lepardi Jourdan is said to reside.\n\nThe jazz trio was fun and added an upbeat element to what was the start of another lovely day in New Orleans."", ""It's been almost 8 years since I last visited and reviewed Muriel's.\n\nI think I've resigned myself to the fact that this is just going to be one of those places that I visit for atmosphere and history, rather than for a phenomenal food. They just don't really seem to be inspired to do anything approaching creative nor outstanding for their vegan and vegetarian customers. It's a traditional kind of place and that is agreeable to a lot of people.\n\nThe restaurant really is lovely and the service is also excellent. Dare I say I just need more these days? I'd expect something a bit more interesting after 8 years.\n\nSo. You'll get a salad with the whatever-makes-it-more-than-just lettuce left off. You'll get a tasty, if unexciting, pasta with vegetable entree. I don't believe there were any dessert options.\n\nI'll be back for wine at the bar and to soak in the beautiful surroundings"", 'For my 1100th review, I review the iconic Muriel\'s Jackson Square, one of the loveliest restaurant/event spaces in New Orleans. I first attended a wedding here on Halloween 2010. My two fabulous friends pulled out all the stops and had an amazing horror movie-themed wedding where Jason and Leatherface got things started with a bang (er, a chainsaw). Sure seems like the folks behind Muriels worked well with my friends and the wedding was an occasion to remember. We were upstairs, where private events are held, and took breaks from the main room in the bordello-like seance room. One of my favorite things about this night included hanging out with cocktails on huge balcony overlooking Jackson Square. \n\nBy the way, if you\'re dining here and there isn\'t an event going on, you\'re free to go upstairs and check all that out. You can even have a drink and bring it up to the Seance Room (and I strongly recommend that you do, if you like rooms dripping in red, chandeliers, velvet and brocade. It makes me want to decorate my entire apartment in a similar fashion). \n\nRecently I came to realize that besides the gorgeous environs, the restaurant serves up some really great food and drink. My friends and I had lunch here recently. We were seated in the room where they open the huge glass doors to the sidewalk so you can watch passersby and listen to music being played out in Jackson Square. \n\nAt lunchtime, they offer $4 Bloody Marys, wines and martinis. I indulged in a Bloody Mary, as I am often wont to do, and found it to be quite satisfactory (garnished with olives, pickled green beans and citrus and served in a pint glass. No skimping here just cuz it\'s a mere 4 bucks). \n\nI ordered the modestly-named Vegetable Plate. I\'ll be honest and say I wasn\'t expecting much because I\'ve had many a pedestrian veg plate where they barely even marinate the vegetables before skewering them and grilling. Booooring. \n\nI\'m thrilled to report that Muriel\'s Vegetable Plate belongs in the Vegetable Plate Hall of Fame. First of all, it contains braised kale. Almost \'nuff said there, but I\'ll go on to say its flavor is just so so so very good. The other star of the plate is that compact square of polenta flavored with herbs and Parm cheese. Everything is so delicately placed, which I love, and nothing overwhelmed with oils or heavy sauces to ""make up for"" the fact that you\'re eating a plate of vegetables. There\'s a delightful little bit of everything from beets to parsnips to tender shittake mushrooms. A healthy, hearty plate. Thank you, Muriels! I seriously could not stop thinking about it all day.\n\nThey also have a gluten-free menu.\n\nI think I\'ll be dining here on the regular when I have visitors in town. It\'s just the perfect place to take them when they want the quintessential French Quarter dining experience.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,50.0

When they suggested we wrap the meat in the bounty of fresh herbs and dip it in the sauce, I hesitated...for maybe two seconds. The fresh herbs complemented the rich flavors of the meat and were only elevated by the light sauce provided. Hot damn, y\'all. Hot damn. \n\nDid I mention we also ordered cornbread? Dios mio. \n\nWith drinks and a copious amount of food, I couldn\'t believe how affordable it all was. I have an internal struggle telling Yelp about this because it really was one of the best meals I\'ve had in New Orleans as of recent. \n\nDid we leave smelling like the sweet aroma of ""I want that""? We sure did. Did we care? Not in the least bit.', ""I LOVE Marjie's Grill. First, I walked in and the place smelled amazing. And when I tasted the food, I was still just as impressed. My friend L and I ordered a bunch of stuff that I can't remember anymore, but everything was very tasty. If they are serving grilled sweet potatoes, get them. I also really loved the pork knuckles. \n\nDo yourself and favor and eat here!"", 'This was the only restaurant I visited during my trip to New Orleans that was worth repeating. Marjie\'s Grill serves a type of fusion cuisine that I had never seen before, pairing Southeast Asian flavors with Gulf Coast barbecue dishes. The chefs slow grill their meats over coal Santa Maria-BBQ style in the restaurant\'s backyard. The selection of spices and produce used to prepare the vegetable sides are purchased from local farmer markets.\n\nThis type of food gets me excited, because it\'s inventive, local, and demonstrates culinary sophistication, unlike some trendy (but boring) Asian fusion concept nowadays that may involve permutations of tacos, buns, french french fries, heavy sauces, and meat.\n\nI stopped by Marjie\'s for two casual lunches. The menu was simple during lunchtime with a few weekly options. Essentially, you build a one dish meal consisting of a meat, vegetable sides, and rice. You can add as many vegetable sides as you want to the plate, I would recommend trying two at a time.\n\nDuring my first visit, I had the BBQ pork shoulder that was thinly sliced, slightly peppery, with charred edges, glistening of pork fat, topped with a garlicky and sour relish that tasted like a Thai or Vietnamese dipping sauce. On my second visit, I ordered the spice-rubbed Gulf fish that\'s delicately charred on the grill and topped with a orange peel-like citrus seasoning. The white fish was buttery soft, perfect to pair with rice, which is also locally sourced. Both BBQ meats were exceptional and perfectly grilled.\n\nI thought that the vegetable sides were equally as brilliant as the meats. All of the vegetables seemed to have more pickled, bright, and sour flavors than expected, which makes them more complex and interesting. My favorite was the spicy arugula mixed with fresh mint, studded with sliced kumquat and dressed with sambal vin. What made this side special were the pure sweetness of the kumquats (even the peels) and sourness of the citrus salsa. I loved tasting these ""dressings"" derived from whole natural ingredients. The braised greens in chili vinegar was what I believe to be a creative take on Southern collard greens, but not prepared the Southern way of being bland. It\'s glazed and spiced up to be bright and pungent, reminding me of Thai flavors. I also enjoyed the cabbage w/ scallions & carrots, all briefly charred on the grill and topped with sesame. As for the most interesting side, I would pick the spicy green beans, apparently pounded in a mortar and pestle.\n\nIf you\'re in New Orleans, I would recommend checking it out.

Y\'all may be aware of my pizza obsession. After a confusing Yelp search, I realized this location had very recently moved... not far, but across the street. Now in the plaza with Burger Monger, we found it easily via Google Maps, with lots of great parking. \n\nI was surprised at how sparse the dining area is! We commandeered two large round tables, which was sufficient for our group of 9, but I only remember seeing a couple of small square tables still available for others dining in. However, it looked like most customers order for take out. So while I\'d noticed that we\'d taken over the bulk of their tables & seating, it didn\'t seem to impact their Wednesday night business.\n\nOn to the pizza... WOW! The crust was what I think of as ""Brooklyn style""... hand-tossed but very thin. Delicious! It was perfectly crisp, not burnt, and not soggy nor doughy. We ordered their white pizza with spinach & chicken, and I LOVED it. The next day, I was additionally pleased at how well it tasted warmed up in my toaster oven at work. \n\nObviously my niece loves this pizza, and I respect my (adult) in-laws\' opinions on pizza as well. New York New York is everything I had hoped it would be... not exactly NYC-style pizza, but outstanding, nonetheless. I\'m delighted to have found a new pizza joint!', 'I was sadly disappointed on my first visit to New York New York Pizza in Carrollwood right after the place opened. And so rather than blast a new restaurant that was trying to get established in the community, I waited for several months and then tried the place again. I should have stuck with my original opinion of this restaurant.\n\nNew York New York Pizza is a small Tampa-based chain with outlets in Ybor City, Hyde Park, Riverview, Westchase, Wesley Chapel, and now Carrollwood. This location is in the shopping center at the corner of Dale Mabry and Linebaugh. It\'s the same shopping center as Publix, Tijuana Flats, Golfer\'s Grail, and Brass Tap\n\nTheir website advertises that they serve slices that are large, wide, thin, and foldable. Their menu also advertises that in addition to pizza, they also serve subs, burgers, wraps, salads, and Italian entrées. That may be the case, but this restaurant is clearly catering to the ""pizza by the slice"" crowd.\n\nOn both of my visits I selected slices from the various pies sitting in their display cases. The cashier lifted the slices onto a round, metal pizza pan, moved them to the pizza oven, and then delivered them to the table a minute or two later. That gave you plenty of time to collect your drink, and find an open seat at a nearby table.\n\nThe crust was crisp, but I certainly would not call this NY-style thin crust. It was more of a normal thickness, and frankly pretty bland. A little more salt in the pizza dough would have helped immensely. This was not a slice of pizza that you could easily \'fold\' lengthwise, but rather a slice that you have to crack the outer rim, and then squeeze it together in order to eat.\n\nThe sauce and the cheese seemed to be in the right proportions, but the sauce was also pretty tasteless, and clearly just sauce out of a can. The amount of toppings was great, but that also contributed to my major issue -- the grease. This was a pizza that I wanted to wring out, or at least blot with several napkins before attempting to eat. The grease was overwhelming, and the slice kinda dribbled the whole time that I was trying to eat it. Hardly appetizing.\n\nSeveral hours after eating a couple of slices, I still had the lingering after-taste of grease in my mouth and belly. A couple of Tums later and I was back to normal. Not a good experience.\n\nI hope that you have a better experience at NY NY Pizzeria than me. I\'m very familiar with NY-style thin crust pizza from Little Italy, and this isn\'t it. Perhaps you\'ll like it, but I don\'t plan on ever going back.', ""NYNY (NY squared or NY with a  G1 Shrapnel vocal Tic) Pizza is located in a plaza on the southbound side of Dale Mabry next to Broken Yolk cafe and a few feet from BurgerMonger.\n\nThey serve NY style pizza by the slice or in whole pie form along with other Italian fare. The interior is yellow and there are a 3-4 circular tables with 3-4 chairs each. It is a bit small and seems intended mostly for the take out.\n\nThe specialty slices are $3 each. 2 specialty slices and a soda are $7, which is not much of a deal. The pieces are big and the crust is crunchy. The cheese/sauce are decent, but not a standout.  \nTheir toppings on the works/supreme pizza are plentiful.\n\nIMO, they are better than average but not as good as Eddie and Sam's in downtown Tampa. Though this is obviously much more convenient than going there. To be honest, I'm not a pizza fanatic these days (I used to like pizza a lot more when I  was little and into TMNT and still had sleepovers lol)\n\nThey are a 3.5/5 imo.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

I\'m ordering the whole damn menu and I\'m going to create a spread that should be for four people not just two.\n\nMy boyfriend and I started with an egg drop soup, dan dan noodles, shrimp wontons, and another item that my boyfriend wanted.\n\nHoly crap those dan dan noodles. Have you ever had a bit of food that is so good you contemplate saying it taste horrible so you don\'t have to share. Well I sure as hell did, because I would\'ve gladly ate this dish all alone or even reheated in the middle of the night while he was asleep. Every bite had the right balance of crunch and texture, my taste buds were really having a trip of their lifetime.\n\nThe spicy chili crunch on the shrimp wontons is fire (but not super spicy at all)! You have to order this dish and share amongst the table, it\'s a great dish and as you start exploring the menu you really do realize that this will be a signature dining experience within the city.\n\nWe hadn\'t even ordered our ""main dishes"" and I was already crying tears of joy with my third glass of wine. (Oh yea, they also serve beer and wine!)\n\nI was intrigued about the crispy beef being a dine-in only dish, so I wanted to take full advantage of the opportunity. I\'m one who stalks a menu for like the whole day and scouring through countless amount of photos so I know ahead of time and make ""casual suggestions"" whenever I\'m dining out. \n\n*I\'m putting my [food] stalking skills for the greater good I keep telling myself.\n\nSo when the dish comes out, I made sure to let my boyfriend have the first few bites. Balance, y\'all balance. So when his eyes lit up, I was like hot damn this is gonna be a treat. So I use my chopsticks and pick up a bite and put it into my mouth. \n\nChefs Kiss.\n\nI was ready to go behind the kitchen and just hug the kitchen. I can\'t give proper justice to this dish; however, I can see that the reason it\'s not available for to-go/takeout is because I understand it wouldn\'t give proper justice to this dish. It has to absolutely be served straight from the kitchen.\n\nNow the surprise winner of the night for me was the char siu pork. So f*ck#ng tender and literally would break apart from the touch of the chopstick. It was so good that I ate a second dish of it alone. My mouth is actually drooling while I\'m typing this out haha.\n\nBlue Giant is just such a romantic and hella cute spot.

Thanks to Tomas' glowing review, I had a feeling that Blue Giant would be perfect. \n\nThis place is the sh$&.  \n\nThe staff warmly welcomed us into this hip joint.

They were spicy and so rich. \n\nI'm looking forward to a girls' night here when COVID gives us back our lives."", 'Buzz has been surrounding Blue Giant for months and I already had a plan of action going in. I find with these hot-spots it\'s best to try and go at lunch, so I headed over around 1 p.m. on a Saturday. There was a bit of a wait, but we quickly settled into a booth in the cozy dining room. \n\nI love the atmosphere of this spot. It\'s small inside, but not cramped, and the open kitchen provides thrills as you wait for your food. There are a few booths and more seating at the bar space, overlooking the kitchen. Peking ducks hang in the kitchen\'s window, tempting those dining to try one out for taste.\n\nOnto the food! I started with an order of egg rolls ($3 each) and an order of the shrimp and pork dumplings. I was so excited about this egg roll; it came out so fresh that it was steaming when I cracked it open. There is a nice crust on the outside, and it has that nice ""crunch"" when you bite into it. It\'s packed with a generous amount of pork and shrimp and the flavors are exotic and familiar. I love a good egg roll and Blue Giant\'s immediately jumped to the top of my ""must order"" list. The dumplings are another star; they are pan fried and come with a nice lacy crust on the outside, almost akin to edible art. The dumplings themselves are soft and flavorful and filled with tender pork and shrimp. They have a very light crunch on the outside, while the inside is soft and melts in your mouth.\n\nFor my entrée I got the Salt and Pepper Catfish. This is piece of catfish sliced, battered and fried, almost tempura style, and served with sautéed onions and peppers, which added some spice. The catfish itself was light and it was a dish that would have easily paired well with some of the other offerings on the menu, especially if you\'re visiting for dinner and you\'re looking to go ""all out.""\n\nDon\'t go into Blue Giant expecting an authentic trip through the Orient or typical greasy American-Chinese take-out. The dishes here err more on the side of Chinese-inspired, but if you like Chinese with an American twist, as I do, then this will be the place for you. \n\n*Portions of this review was written, by me, for Offbeat Magazine.

We ordered crispy orange beef (has chilis in it to give a touch of heat but very orangy), Singapore rice noodle-House special (my fav), squid with snap peas and ginger and chicken lo mein.  The portions are ENORMOUS.  Add to all that goodness, the fact that if you spend more than $45 you get free fried rice (we got the BBQ pork) which is also huge!

I've tried some other dishes, including Kung Pao beef, chicken, and shrimp, as well as a couple of others - they've all been great - but it's the orange spicy beef that keeps me coming back.

Larger than other artichokes we\'ve had at other establishments, this one had a nice slightly grilled char on the inside halves, but didn\'t taste all charcoal-y like others we\'ve had in the past. Nicely seasoned, it also had a hint of lemon. It was served with a mayo based rémoulade which had hints of roasted peppers & garlic. It was a devine pairing with the lemony \'choke leaves.\n\nThe wife ordered the Brisket/Sirloin blend Sliders served with glazed onions for her main lunch course & I, the Urban Burger w/bacon cooked at a juicy medium. I placed the fresh tomato & red onion slices under the top half of the soft pillow-y bun. At first bite it was perfectly cooked w/hints of red meat mingling with clear juices & the melted Tillamook cheddar. Put a dollop of Fork\'s burger sauce on that bite & it\'s OH SO effen GOOD! The burger came with a side of these Rosemary/Parmesan fries that the wife & I shared. She really liked them, but for me, though hot & gave off the aroma of rosemary, they were ""dry"" as if baked rather than fried in oil. The powdered parm cheese that lined the fries left a chalky aftertaste in my mouth that I didn\'t care for. HINT: It\'s better when dipped in the Fork burger sauce, yo! So ask for more. I washed it all down with my 2nd beer, the Sockeye Dagger Falls IPA (by Sockeye Brewing Boise, ID).\n\nSteve never left us wanting & always kept our water glasses topped off. All in all, this was a solid dining experience & is on my list of places to revisit when back in the Boise area. Nicely done FORK, you\'ve made a loyal customer out of me! 4.5 Stars!\n\nEat well & drink responsibly...this has been another deez® review because you need it & want it. Enjoy the day.', ""I'm going to be honest, while the ambience was fun because it was packed, this wasn't a love fest for me.  We stopped and had 2 drinks and deep fried asparagus, which was delicious.  Our drinks however, were smaller shots so we weren't impress.  We decided to cut our losses and head out to try a different restaurant. The price were great and we can check it off the list for awhile.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

We were really impressed with them. The only thing I'd recommend for others that have this issue, is to get there as early as possible so the passport can be issued the same day. As they issue passports at noon, and 2pm, so you need to get there at least 2 or 3 hours before in case something happens and there are others there. If you plan it that way, you really shouldn't have a problem obtaining it here as they are very accommodating, nice, and intelligent here. Definitely NOT your average government workers.

Also some Asian street eats, like fishballs on a stick, wasabi chicken, lobster balls, etc., etc.\n\nOn a quiet weekday mid-afternoon the restaurant had several people coming in to get take out orders, including myself. I ordered a Zhajiang Mian (after asking the lady owner if it was *authentic* - duh - like, what was she going to say, NO?), the much-hyped Volcano Noodles, a side of fish balls and the wasabi chicken.\n\nWhile each noodle dish was around or over $10, with the current Groupon deal, or an Uber Eats discount for your first order, the prices were very reasonable. \n\nSince we didn't eat our food for over an hour after buying it, I'm sure the noodle consistency was affected. However, the noodle dishes tasted fine - basic Zhajiangmian sauce - not overly sweet like some places. The Volcano noodles were also OK, not overly spicy, and the portion is generous. Fish balls tasted pretty authentic (ie. Fishy, as they should be, with the right amount of springy texture, in my opinion), but the wasabi chicken seemed refried, though the flavors were fine.\n\nLike others said, perhaps this new place is trying to find itself in the ocean of recently-opened noodle shops.

Good thing it wasn't busy because it took me 5 minutes to pick one. I had the vegetarian Dan Dan Noodle which is wheat noodles in a mild spicy sauce with sesame, ya cai, chili oil, green onion, and Sichuan pepper. I have a moderate tolerance for spice and thought it was more mild+ than mild. The sauce was more than just spiciness; it was multidimensional and packed a lot of flavor. You could taste all the individual ingredients yet they formed a cohesive sauce.\n\nDefinitely come here on an empty stomach because they serve a large portion of noodles. It's almost a fault because it would be nice to have a more balanced noodle to sauce ratio. \n\nMian Sichuan broke the stereotype for oriental restaurants of having poor service and being dirty.

I ordered the Chongquing noodles and was so excited that they had a vegetarian option of this as well as others. With this noodle being vegetarian, I expected small amounts of spinach or some other vegetable to substitute the meat, like so many restaurants do. To my surprise they added a good amount tofu, spinach and cucumber. It was delicious! \nThe filling vegetarian options provided is why I gave this place five stars.

Do not be intimidated by your lack of problem-solving, puzzle crushing, number manipulating, or overall intelligence. You'll do fine. There are no complex things going on here.

Falora is small yet stylish. The ambiance is warm and a rad record player with super crisp sound sits on the window sill.  I loved it. The beautiful Italian wood burning oven sets the tone in many ways, but so do the community tables and the awesome back wall that serves as storage for the fire wood. I came in on a Monday night and sat at the bar. It was one of the funnest solo dining experiences yet. The staff (Sam, Kerry and Izzy) was extremely friendly and sweet as can be. I love to ask questions about the menu and this team had all the answers and recommendations too! Lately, I've felt like every where I go staff is poorly trained, they don't know the menu. I had the exact opposite experience here. Not only did they have the answers, they were enthusiastic about the food and have actually tried the food on the menu. I ordered the kale salad, the margherita pizza and finished with a very good macchiato. The kale salad is literally exploding with flavor....quite a bit of it. Kale, artichokes, sun dried tomato and olives. The portion is easily fit for two or as a entree salad. I ate less than half and took the rest home, as I also wanted to save room for my pie. The margherita was thin crust as it should be, the sauce was bright and tangy. A little on the salty side for my palate, but that could easily be me since I don't use very much salt in general. The pizza was super tasty. And they use an entire ball of fresh Mozzarella! Great quality ingredients. The entire meal was super fresh and clean just as you would expect given Ari's other establishments. They also try to support local producers and vendors as much as possible which is always wonderful to see and worth the price, in my opinion. For me, it's refreshing to have a bite to eat that's simple and straight forward, as the Italians do in Italy. I waited to come to allow Falora to settle in a newbie in town.

It was my first experience with Izakaya style food. I've had Spanish Tapas before in Barcelona, but never had Japanese Tapas. It was a real treat! I'm still thinking about all the yummy things that we ordered for lunch. The menu is full of appetizers, small plates, sushi, sashimi, ramen & udon, rice, grilled fish, meats, and veggies. You can even have a low carb feast here as they have so many skewer options. They have all kinds of unique snacks. Things that I would only imagine seeing in places like NYC. It really does have that whole Japanese pub feel about it. Very comfortable and unpretentious. The service from Joy and other staff there made it even better. Joy had awesome recommendations for us starting with the spicy octopus cups and the strawberry nigori sake. Her description of it sounded perfect and she was right on target. Definitely get the Homare strawberry nigori if you like that hint of sake mixed with a strawberry smoothie taste and feel. I shared the bottle because it would have been too much alcohol for me (yeah I'm a lightweight), and my friend also loved it too. They offered to give us 2 sake glasses without even asking. Great service!!\n\nAnyway, it was so difficult to decide. The menu is extensive and there are just so many things that I wanted to try. I ended up getting the spicy octopus cup. It was exactly what I wanted. I normally get the scallop but the octopus was perfect. I also got the fried oysters after others raved about it in the reviews. They were so right. The oyster tasted so light and fresh. The panko coating was super light and crispy. I was also blown away by the eel skewer. The eel was so tasty and meaty. I'm used to having very thin slices on top of a sushi roll. This eel was thicker and had some fat on it. I loved the sweet eel sauce coating as well. You will want another skewer so you may want to order 2 of them.\n\nI did get the tonkotsu ramen lunch special that comes with a salad. I probably didn't need it but I couldn't pass it up. The ginger dressing was very good, and the salad was cool and fresh. The ramen was excellent overall. I know some places have a better presentation, but not all of them have a perfectly marinated egg. This egg was delicious! The yolk had that custard consistency and that salty umami taste was present as well. That's what really made the ramen stand out to me. Oh and that huge slice of braised pork belly was seriously calling my name. It was a fattier piece of pork belly than I'm used to. I won't lie, there were times I was just chewing on fat but it really was full of flavor. The broth was your average tonkotsu broth that I love. I've only had it at 4 other restaurants. I can say that the broth on this day wasn't as salty as others I've had in the area. I tasted more of the pork which I'm happy with. I only wish that it had black garlic oil added to it. That would have put it over the top for me. The noodle to broth ratio was good. In fact, I didn't eat all of the noodles because I had to try my friend's appetizers. Yes, that was my excuse for not eating all of it.\n\nI sampled the Lollipop Roll which is your typical Naruto roll, but it was presented beautifully with lollipop sticks. The Passionate Salmon Roll was excellent. I love salmon but never thought to pair it with passion fruit pulp. It was very refreshing and light. Oh, and I sampled the bacon wrapped scallop. That was also good as well. It was all perfect including the atmosphere. Just a chill and relaxing place where you can unwind during lunch or at the end of the day. I got NYC vibes there, but that may be just because I saw a couple of people wearing Yankees caps and the décor on the walls and the bar area reminded me of the city that doesn't sleep. \n\nSo, parking is kind of weird. There isn't much of it around. It's really typical of South Tampa restaurants not to have a lot of space for that. They do have a parking area around back which is for all the businesses in that plaza. I haven't been there during peak times but I was able to find a spot around back. I can't wait to go back and try the Shiso Rangoon, Seafood Ceviche, and Garlic Butter Bok Choy. I had such a wonderful lunch experience!""]",0.25,0.0,0.25,0.5,0.0,1.0,30.0

It is my first tattoo, but my wife and I have been thinking and planning our tattoos for quite some time. We didn\'t intend to go to Hell or High Water (aka F* You Tattoo). In fact, it was somewhat of an accident. In fact, we had intended to get our tattoo at Eye Candy. \n\nHere\'s how our story goes. I had contacted Eye Candy via email. Unfortunately, tattoo artists aren\'t the most reliable of people, and despite confirming an appointment with my friend, the artist that we had signed up with at Eye Candy did not have me or my wife down for an appointment. My friend, however, did get his in (with Erica at Eye Candy). Frustrated, I asked Michael at Eye Candy if he had any other recommendations. And where did he recommend we go? ""Go to Jordan at Hell or High Water."" \n\nI remembered Hell or High Water, as it had the guy with the face tats sitting out front. Of course, someone with a face tattoo evokes a certain response from some people, and I admit that I was at first taken a little back. Luckily, Skitch (I hope I spelled that right) could not have been nicer. \n\nSo we ambled in to Hell or High Water, and Skitch worked his magic, dealing with both me and my wife quickly and professionally. We paged through his book and he had some seriously good stuff. Jordan, one of the other artists, was out, as was Tony. Skitch had the idea of him inking my wife and another artist, Jimmy, doing my tattoo.\n\nSkitch--His bedside manner could teach doctors a thing or two. Jimmy is a crazy mofo, but one very good artist. Jimmy took to calling me ""Marty"" because he liked it better than Jarrod. About 2.5 hours later, I was done (my wife was done a bit earlier). Needless to say, the cost to quality ratio was amazing. Skitch and Jimmy have about 50 years of experience between the two of them, and we couldn\'t be happier. If and when I decide to do this again, you bet that I\'ll be coming back here.', ""First off the decor in this place is awesome - lots of taxidermy and macabre art. They also play great music.

It was a huge hit.  My pasta was delicious!

I tried the general tso and sweet and sour chicken, but I don\'t recommend anything fried unless you like really thick hard batter. It reminds me of frozen chicken. On their menu it says they do not use MSG. They cook everything to order so nothing is under heat lamps, but with a place this tiny they would have no room for pre made food anyway.

Because it is solid Chinese food that you can get cheap and fast in the area.

They have the type of sweet and sour sauce that I like and they are not stingy if you ask for extra.  There is rice is okay at best.  It is a little too yellow for my taste.  But its not bad.  There mandarin sauce is very tasty and nutty.  I usually just pour this on everything because I hate my arteries.  The egg roll isn\'t very large but isn\'t the small kid on the block either.  \n\nBelieve it or not their shrimp dishes are really the stand outs. Which is shocking for what is pretty much Chinese fast food when you really think about it (there is really is no inside. I think they have one table).   The grilled chicken dishes are flavorful as well and contain a multitude of veggies.\n\nOn the not so great side, their won ton soup has a nice flavor and tons of dumplings in it, but nothing else.

Please I am begging you! I like spicy, so don\'t ""protect"" me!

Both were equally pleasing in their own way (stout was full of flavor--porter was lovely and smooth with subtle notes of chocolate).\n\nWe ordered at the bar and took our beers to their upstairs seating area. The atmosphere downstairs is open, industrial, and a skosh on the noisy side. Upstairs it's a little quieter, a little comfier, and a bit more chill.  \n\nPlus--foosball anyone? \n\nWe were able to chill in relative peace, overlooking the activity below for 45 minutes.  I'm not sure the waitstaff actually serves up there (servers came upstairs and cleared away empties--but didn't address us other than that).  But, truly, the place is so small, and the service at the bar was so quick and friendly, I have no probably heading to the bar for refills.\n\nThe downstairs bar/seating area opens up to a small patio area as well.  It's not fancy, and a little no frills--but you can definitely enjoy a brew while sitting in the fresh autumnal air.\n\nFor my part, I could definitely see myself heading down to enjoy a brew and chill sesh in their upstairs loft.\n\nGet to it!"", 'I found myself rather amused while reading some of the negative reviews from other Yelpers about Boise Brewing. Comments criticizing the industrial warehouse atmosphere, the ""cacophonous racket"" of brewers doing their job in an open landscape, and the limited selection of beers make it apparent that there are people in the community who haven\'t fully grasped and appreciated the concept of a craft brewery and taproom.\n\n1) Industrial warehouse atmosphere and open landscape: Boise Brewing is first and foremost a brewery. I believe any true beer enthusiast would relish the opportunity to ""find the source"" of the craft brews they so enjoy. Ordering a beer and knowing it was conceptualized and made literally feet from where it\'s being poured from the tap into my glass is truly thrilling. In addition, being able to witness the brewers brewing (and having fun while doing it!) and talking to the people making the product I\'m consuming makes me feel connected to the process. However, if people wish for a more private and quiet experience, there is an upstairs seating area away from the brewing floor that doesn\'t seem to get much traffic. In addition, growler fills are available and affordable if patrons would rather take their beer elsewhere. \n\n2) ""Limited"" selection of beers--This is perhaps the most laughable gripe of all. Boise Brewing is a local craft brewery, not a corporate conglomerate, meaning they have a small amount of space and fermenting tanks, and are limited on the number of kegs they can produce before they are affected by distribution laws. In spite of this, they currently feature five of their house-brewed staple beers (all of varying styles), as well as two or three guest taps from other regional breweries AND some wine selections. Seven or eight available draft craft beers (of high quality) plus a wine selection is more than what the average ""bar"" has available. While there are certainly locations in the area with a larger, more extensive beer list, there is something to be valued in getting the product from its source, as well as buying local. \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Boise Brewing. Kathy, the ""brew-tender,"" was very friendly, welcoming, and attentive. She gladly answered questions and happily offered samples of any beer I wanted to try. For patrons looking for a more formal lounge feel and a beer lineup from who knows where, this is perhaps not the place for you.

In this time I changed my colors myself, played with them and did all sorts of other stuff but they didn\'t look great with my overgrown natural nail anymore. I went nice and early, I was promptly serviced (they\'re truly efficient) and this time it was a different guy. He was attentive and quick.\n\nWhen he removed the nail polish I noticed a dark spot under my index fingernail but thought that maybe it was dirt and didn\'t worry too much. He continued doing his job, filing away until he got to that finger. He got a different file (pointy tapered one) and started filing under my ""dirty"" index and the spot didn\'t go away. After prodding and filing (and the spot still there) he just said ""You play with dirt? Haha."" and didn\'t remove the nail to clean it or to figure out what was there, he just layered on more acrylic and kept on going.\n\nThis truly bothered me because I thought it might be a bacterial infection, so as soon as I got home I started removing my freshly filled-in nails; starting by the index nail. What I found was truly disgusting (refer to pictures to see it) I didn\'t know whether it was a chunk of my nail falling or what, but it looked ""unhygienic"" to say the least.\n\nI filed whatever it was away myself and soaked it with lots of alcohol just in case and it eventually fell. This only tells me that the tools they\'re using are filthy and rarely even disinfected, which in my opinion is simply not right. \n\nIf you still decide to visit this place, do it under your own risk and keeping in mind that what they use on you might have been used on plenty of other people without being cleaned in between you and the other clients.', 'After so many years of living in Tampa, I finally found my place to get my nails Instagramable! \n\nAs an influencer in Tampa who writes about food, it is essential that my nails are always on point.

It just wasn't entirely satisfying and made me miss the Indian food back in New York, so I'm not so sure about all this hype here.  Also, I think they charged us 3 dollars for a diet coke each, which is just absolutely ridiculous to me."", 'Saffron has solid Indian food.

It was a turn off that naan was $2.50, and garlic naan was $3.50.\n\nThe restaurant is clean, but the seats are a little uncomfortable. The staff is friendly, but the man whom I believe is the owner can be a little off-putting with his interactions. I asked him if the chicken butter masala was like a hybrid of tikka masala and butter chicken and he said no, which was confusing because both are tomato-based sauces.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

It was accompanied with rice, black beans, salad and salsa. The jackfruit was moist with so much flavor. You would not know it wasn't meat carnitas. The side dishes were delicious. I also tried the tamale plate. It came with your choice of carne chili (vegan) or green chili tamale (vegetarian) or get one of each. Both were so good. Service was very friendly and entrees come with soup. There's complimentary coffee which was very good also. It can get busy during lunch time but it's worth the wait."", 'Everything about this place is amazing. \n\nThe service from the time of ordering, quick delivery of food to the table and vibe they exude is just the start of what will be one of the best meals you have had. \n\nI ended up with the ropa vieja plate.

Out of this world flavors, not too heavy and if you ask for their homemade hot sauce you have a reason to excuse the tears of joy. \n\nIf you even dare a pouty face for no meat you have to leave that feeling behind you. If you did not once you read all ingredients for the dishes your excitement will mount, from scratch. \n\nMy partner was pleased with her meal and finished the plate without me tasting anything and there was no jealousy my side. I had an espresso too and I did taste her horchata latte. Both solid and the latter was not too anything except satisfying. \n\nOne consideration is parking.

I initially scheduled an appointment with Debi, the owner.  First, she rescheduled my appointment online without first verifying this was okay with me and later called to ask.  The morning of my appointment she texted me to cancel because she was sick.  She did not attempt to reschedule this appointment so I did it myself online for earlier this week.  When I got to the salon, she said ""I was going to call you but I figured you were already on your way.  We are discontinuing the lashglaze because people are having allergic reactions.""  She offered a lash tint instead.  I didn\'t realize until after I\'d had this done that a lash tint is actually worth about half that of a lash glaze.  I appreciate she is trying to honor the livingsocial while not hurting her clients, but she should be more honest about this or pull the livingsocial deal entirely and issue refunds.\n\nWhile I was having my lashes tinted, Debi talked me into scheduling a Brazilian with her for today.  I have had a lot of trouble with in-grown hairs after waxing in the past and Debi convinced me that she may be more successful at preventing this problem.  I showed up for the appointment today and Lumi, another esthetician, told me that Debi couldn\'t make it because she was having her hair done.  Lumi offered to do the wax instead.  When we were finished, Debi finally appeared from her hair appointment.  Here is the kicker--I got no apology.  Nothing.  \n\nAll of that said, Lumi is a terrific esthetician.  I was hesitant to even write a negative review because I liked Lumi so much.   If this wax ends up looking pretty good after a few days, I will return to see her.  However, I won\'t be scheduling any more appointments with Debi.', 'Believing that a Brazilian wax job is going to be a painless experience is like believing in Santa Claus. However, there are good waxologists and there are bad ones. If you want a Daniel-san wax-on-wax-off specialist who must\'ve studied under Mr. Miyagi and perfected her craft after years of dealing with women of all shapes and sizes, you must see Lumi at Lunchbox. \n\nThe space is above Goldy\'s on Capitol and although it\'s tres chic, the chicks couldn\'t be more down to earth. I felt at home, didn\'t feel shy about laying on a table with no pants on, and most importantly, didn\'t feel judged like I might have at a more ""uppity"" place. Lumi had read my comment on the online booking system before I came in (first timer) and was extremely personable, professional, and patient. Most of all, she was fast, supportive, understanding, and good at her job.\n\nLunchbox has a points program for repeat customers and discounts on Saturdays for students. It\'s also the only place I\'ve ever been to that offers numbing cream or spray before a wax- why don\'t they all?!\n\nSo, although it wasn\'t painless, it was infinitely more pleasant than I thought it could be. \n\nHighly recommend!!', 'LunchBOX waxing is a testament to Yelp\'s value in a country where people are hopelessly hairy, but have no idea where to find relief.  It was through Yelp that I found this place.\n\nAnd waxing isn\'t a topic one could easily broach with a local church group, or the crowd over at Hansen\'s Hardware or Concrete Cornucopia (""Serving *all* of your concrete needs since 1951"").\n\nLunchBOX is apparently a nation-wide franchise with stores as far flung as our legs when spread-eagled and waiting for a bikini wax - Florida to Idaho, Utah to Arizona.\n\nThe space is professional and clean, with several discreet rooms.  The set up is very similar to other waxing places I\'ve visited.  However, it was my esthetician - Tina - who made the place a standout.  Her waxing was even less painful than tailgating an elderly person driving a big boat, going 15mph down a 35mph zone.  Tina was also very thorough with the ingrowns - something many other estheticians don\'t bother with.  (Even the tweezing didn\'t hurt.)  The only thing different about LunchBOX is that they don\'t apply a cream or ""calming salve"" at the end of the procedure, which is something every other waxing place I\'ve been to has offered.  However, the experience was so painless there was nothing to ""calm"", if you know what I mean.\n\nA wonderful find and even worth driving that 15mph downtown from the north end.']",0.0,0.5,0.5,0.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

This shouldn\'t happen, nor has it ever happened to me. I\'m actually shocked one is falling off and one chipped because the powder is supposed to be strong after curing. Also, my cuticles were not pushed down or cut, so now they have grown out a ridiculous amount already. \n\nOverall, I won\'t be going back. I did not like the dip powder and it was far too expensive to be going bad after only a week. I believe if I went back for a fill it would be $30-$35 and that\'s just too much to have this happen again. I\'ve had nails that have lasted almost a month before needing any touch ups.

They agreed to perform the tint job, no problem, and arranged a time to come to my home at my convenience. \n\nUpon arrival, they took the new windshield out and did a final inspection. They had sub-contracted the tint job, and found a couple air bubbles underneath. I am a perfectionist when it comes to stuff like this, and these guys hold the same standard.

Within an hour after that, I had a brand new windshield complete with tint! Ended up with a much better tint job than could ever be achieved when performing tinting with the window already installed :)\n\nThese guys get my highest rating - this is how a small business should be run, by people educated in their craft that maintain a high level of personal accountability and excellence.

The first time was great, but the second move which happened almost a week ago was the worst moving experience I have had. I work for the largest private employer in Tucson and move quite a bit for the role that I have. My first move was coordinated by Moving Buddies through the owner, Jim Boeher. He seems professional and helpful, and he sent two men who knew that time was money and that my quote officially given to me was for two hours. I had a one bedroom apartment with barely any furniture, since I travel light. I moved about 8 miles away and paid 87/hour plus another 87 for a traveling fee. In two hours my stuff was packed and moved to my new location, and I was very happy with the service. My most recent move however, was a completely different story. The movers assessed my belongings and said it would take an hour for them to pack up and head to my new place which was 5 miles away. The movers had given me the same exact quote I received on my first move, which made sense to me since I had only half of the same amount. My stuff fit in the tiniest UHAUL storage unit to give you a better indication of how little I had with me. I had the movers for 2 hours so with taxes included I would be at around $216. Well, an hour and a half into my 2 hours, I don't see any signs of my movers. I was at my apartment waiting and called. They had got stuck behind a funeral procession. When they finally got to my place, they decided they had to turn the truck around. Jim, the owner was now one of the movers. He brought along another gentleman who was GREAT. Jim however, was in no physical shape to be moving anything. He was also in no hurry to quickly move things and it was his employee who ended up doing most the work. At a certain point, I notice we are 3 hours in (my friend and I were also helping with the movers to save time). I see Jim taking his time just sweeping the truck and ask him to stop the time. I also told him that my quote was for 2 hours and that they took 3. He told me he wouldn't stop the time until  I ran back to my apartment and brought down his employee and tore down boxes. I went and grabbed his employee and ask Jim again to stop the time. He says he will as soon as he turns the truck around. This made NO sense, since I have a one way entrance and exit out of my apartment complex, and the truck was already in the right direction to leave. I start telling him I think that is unnecessary to which he begins yelling at me and calling me manipulative. I pay for his 3 hours and gave no tips. I also told him that he should have quote his customers correctly and survey their belongings. I felt cheated that he told me 2 hours and that he did my first move in the same time. He told me he fired the movers who did my move the first time, and I told him that they were excellent. Bottom line: Jim has little understanding of customer satisfaction or respect. He also is physically out of shape and should be hiring people to do the moves , so that he doesn't have to. It takes him much longer to move the smallest things and he has no incentive or desire to hustle to help you out time wise.

I'm super picky about Mexican food so as always I'm super hesitant to try new places.  My first experience with Xtreme Tacos I was lucky it wasn't very busy and they were at 7venth Sun Brewery in Seminole Heights.  The food was fantastic but I didn't realize how much of a following they have.  Trust me when I say there's a high probability that you will see someone you know and haven't seen in a while if hangout next to the truck waiting for your food.  The last few times I went to Xtreme Tacos they parked outside of C.1949 for Taco Tuesday.  The food pretty darn delicious.  I haven't taken any pictures just because I was too hungry to wait to eat.  \nNow a few tips/tricks: \n1.  Everything is awesome if you're not a vegetarian or vegan but are looking to health it up definitely go for one of the vegetarian/vegan options. \n2. Make a plan, if you know they will be somewhere call ahead to place your order. Seriously the line legit never dies down.  \n3. If you do have to stand in line just order the whole menu.  It just smells so good plus you keep seeing people walk away with delicious looking and smelling food it's hard to narrow it down.  Or come in a group and have everyone order something different.  \n4. This is a food truck it travels so try and follow them on Facebook or Instagram so you can be prepared ahead of time.  \n\n\nWhen I'm craving tacos and beer I generally look to see where Xtreme tacos is going to be and I get beer and taco fix."", ""If you find yourself hungry for some Mexican food in Seminole Heights, Xtreme Tacos is a solid choice to make. The burritos are extremely filling and loaded. Tacos are as well.\n\nIt doesn't quite beat the Mexican food I enjoy in California, but it's still better than most places in Tampa. You'll spend on average $10-20 which is about standard for Tampa as well.\n\nSo far I've had the Carne Asada (steak) which was pretty good and also the Carnitas which was also solid. The chips and salsa are also good and worth the extra few bucks if you're really hungry. \n\nThey're saving up for a restaurant in Seminole Heights so look for that in the next few months."", ""It must've been a bad day for the food truck. I've ordered from them before though post mates food delivery when they had their restaurant previously and it was delicious. I ordered 2 steak tacos and the chicken taquitos, which is the same things I ordered before. During this visit the chicken in the taquitos were dry and tasted bland with absolutely no flavor at all. Unfortunately  they were completely un-edible and and tasted like they were re-heated after being out for too long.  Comparable to a similar quality you'd find in the freezer isle at your local grocery store.  I ordered to go and decided to eat everything on the way home. I didn't realize until after reaching in the bag that there were no napkins or cutlery included, in addition to the salsa I asked for.  I should've checked the bag before I left the ordering area but decided to trust that everything I needed was in the bag. The steak tacos were cold and super chewy. I've heard a lot of great things about this place but think that the restaurant quality is better than the food truck. I'll probably wait before visiting again for their new location to open. At least at that point I'll know that the ingredients are fresh.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0

The ambiance here is incredible; recently renovated its a bright beautiful space. It's got a very upscale dining atmosphere and their upscale spin on food complements each other well. I noticed the menu had most of its sandwiches moderately priced at $14 includes soup, salad, or fries. For today; I was able to order their culinary spin on the chicken sandwich, fries, and desert for only $10. The chicken sandwich was lightly battered, fresh pico, and ghost pepper cheese on a ciabatta roll (packed some heat). The desert was impeccable just look at it haha.

I was impressed with the staff and decided I would come back to receive a Pico Genesis Treatment. \n\nThis is a laser treatment used in laser skin resurfacing to decrease pigmentation and increase collagen in the skin. It is non-ablative, meaning that it does not remove layers of skin. It can be used to treat melasma, hyperpigmentation, brown spots, sun damage, age spots, pigmented lesions, and acne scars. The treatment lasted about 20 minutes. There is no down time, other than my face was a bit red for about an hour afterwards. It takes on average about two weeks to see the results. Usually 2-4 treatments may be needed to get the desired results.\n\nStaff was so nice and accommodating. They spent time with me to ensure I was getting the right treatment for my face and desired results. I have to say I saw terrific results with one treatment, however would want to get 1-2 more. Results noticed by me and others include smoother skin, brighter skin tone, decrease in size of pores on and around nose that we get as we age, improved appearance of wrinkles. The number one thing that people commented on was that my skin was so smooth. I never told anyone other than the yelp world I was having this performed so these comments came to me unsolicited by friends. I'm not so sure how long these results will last. A question I have for the staff. I highly suggest this treatment and this business."", ""I'm obsessed with the HydraFacial! So obsessed that I surprised HubbyStanks with one for our 15 year anniversary. He's wanted one ever since he saw how my skin was glowing when I got home from my first HydraFacial. As a dude, I knew he wasn't going to go for the first time on his own so I knew this would be the perfect gift. I booked a few days before and they fit us right in!\n\nSo, why am I obsessed with this facial in particular? I've been looking for a facial where they use a suction machine for many, many years. I have no idea why this isn't an option for all facials. I had one facial done when I was in massage school (yes in another life I was a massage therapist before I went to college full time) and the same school owned a beauty school next door that used a suction tool to extract. Every facial I had since then was all manual extractions using fingers only. I have nothing against that, because during the HydraFacial they still manually extract in certain areas. However, there are parts of your face where fingers and metal tools just won't work! The pores on my cheeks and my jawline need love too!\n\nI was nervous at first because, well, I'm funny about anything on my face. Not because of the tools, but because of the peels and serums. I'm sensitive and I use natural products for the most part, so I was afraid I'd have a reaction. Nope, not at all. My face reacted wonderfully to this treatment!\n\nI am also impressed by the Zo products by Obaji. Obaji is known as high quality in dermatology circles. So far they have been great on my skin.\n\nThe next time I come in I'm definitely buying the VIP membership. Not only do you get a discount on the HydraFacial, but you get 20% off of other services and I'm really thinking about getting laser hair removal done here.\n\nThe staff goes out of their way to make the visit extremely comfy.\nYou are offered water, tea, and coffee during your visit. When we found out how good the coffee was we had to try it. It really is a good quality espresso that they brew. The Erasable Team makes sure you are nice, warm and relaxed while you are laying on the table. They also play your choice of music during your treatment. \n\nI highly recommend trying Erasable for any med spa treatment you are thinking of getting."", ""Went in for my first round of laser hair removal after seeing a demonstration at a Yelp event. I'll be totally candid and disclose that I am trying out this procedure on my underarms. I was able to view a demonstration on this area and to be honest...I live in Florida and my wardrobe consists of mainly sleeveless shirts. It seems like a good investment!\n\nThe office has appointments as late as 6:30pm which was very convenient since I leave work at 6pm. Upon entering the office, Loretta greeted me and brought me to the lounge to offer coffee or water. She is wonderful. She hosted the Yelp event and remembered me, welcoming me with a smile which was comforting. I filled out my info on an iPad and waited just minutes for my consultation. Loretta and I discussed my health and she answered my questions before the procedure. \n\nThe procedure was painless. She tested levels of intensity and waited about 10 minutes before performing the actual procedure. It took all of 5 minutes and I really did not feel any pain at all. Heat, yes. Pain, no. I am looking forward to future treatments, although I hope it doesn't take too many and i also hope it lasts a long long time! Considering other areas since Erasable Inc is currently running a BOGO special!!!! They've got me hooked!!! I would highly recommend.

The jewelry cases are nicely lit and it offer nice ambiance. However, my experience did not match up with what I imagined was a high end shop. \n\nI walked into this shop simply to purchase  a new nose stud after I accidentally threw my original 15 year old piece away. I chose STTP for the overall rating. Upon arriving, there were a few people already inside. I had to get in line to sign up for an appointment to select a new piece of jewelry. I thought it was a little odd since all I needed was a new stud. My piercing is 15 years old, so I didn\'t imagine I\'d need help putting a new one in. Anyway, they said it was free to put it in so I accepted their offer. While we waited, more and more people piled into the shop. While I very much appreciate that they have contactless payment set-up, there were no physical distancing measures in place. I waited approximately 20-25 minutes and for me, it was uncomfortable to see so many people inside the shop. \n\nWhen it came to selecting my new nose stud, I was underwhelmed by their selection. I have sensitive skin so surgical steel is the best option for me. Studs are $15.00 and nothing special.  After selecting the new piece they took it to the back to get cleaned and I was directed to little space in the back that seemed sufficiently sterile. \n\nThe staff member who put my new stud in had sterile equipment that was still in it\'s packaging. The only thing that was skipped over was prepping my skin with an alcohol wipe to at least clean off the area. But I didn\'t give it too much thought since in my 15 years of having a nose stud I had never gotten an infection.  Putting the new piece of jewelry was as painful as the day I got my nose pierced. There was a lot of pressure and I felt a ""pop"" on my cartilage. This made me very nervous and I expressed that to the employee.  I only waited 4 days to replace the stud I had thrown out so there is no way a 15 year old piercing would have needed any form of re-piercing. \n\nNeedless to say, I ended up with an infection- pus, redness, pain. I called the shop on Monday morning but they were closed, so I followed up with a DM on Instagram. No one ever replied to me. I ended up treating the infection with antibiotics. A week later it\'s getting better. \n\nPersonally, I will not recommend this shop to my friends and I don\'t plan on returning. One-star reviews are the last thing I want to publish. I love small business and support them 100% but this was not a good experience and I hope my feedback is taken into consideration. Infections are not to be taken lightly.', ""Witnessed multiple employees not wearing masks, and then claiming they have a medical condition that exempts them from wearing one.\n\nFirst of all, that sign that says they are exempt looks like it was printed off the internet. It's blatant, and it has been shown by many experts that it would be VERY rare to have a condition that would prevent an individual from wearing a mask. I doubt these women have a medical condition, I mean what are the odds BOTH would even. \n\nThis reluctance to wear a mask exemplifies the disrespect they have for their customers, I even overheard them making snide remarks about customers wearing masks themselves. \n\nI have to take my business elsewhere, sorry not sorry!"", 'I recently decided to have an industrial piercing done.  STTP came highly recommended, and I now know why -- it is an exceptional piercing studio in Tucson.  The shop is extremely clean, with a very modern and artistic vibe.  The metal work for the jewelry cases is excellent!  Speaking of the jewelry, it is top notch and plentiful.  So many choices!  The staff is extraordinarily professional, kind, helpful, patient, thorough, and gentle.  Lisa was my piercer, and she was amazing throughout the entire process.  \n\nIt\'s been a while since I\'ve had a piercing, so I had a bunch of questions.  Lisa listened to them all and answered everything thoroughly.  She took every question seriously, even though I thought I was asking some ""stupid"" questions.  She never once made me feel as if any question was stupid.  I felt totally comfortable with her.  During the piercing, she took a lot of time to make sure the placement and angle of the piercing was perfect.  She didn\'t rush the process or ""go through the motions.""  Her expertise and professionalism were of the highest quality.\n\nThe piercing itself was quick and done as gently as possible.  Lisa talked with me through it to help with any potential nerves.  I wasn\'t really that nervous and the pain didn\'t bug me much, but I appreciated her attention and concern for my well-being.\n\nIt\'s important to note that during my approximately 30 minutes spent in STTP (I just walked in, I\'m not sure if they do appointments, sorry), I watched the staff clean and sterilize every surface at least three times.  They pay a lot of attention to cleanliness, which is awesome, and it made me feel really confident with my decision to be pierced at this studio.  \n\nSTTP is doing exactly what a good piercing studio should be doing.  They\'re clean, professional, and cool.  Don\'t hesitate to go to them (and Lisa specifically) when you want a piercing!\n\nEdit to add:  I received a phone call from\n Lisa about two weeks after she did my piercing just so she could check up on me and it.

I tried two appetizers: the $6.95 Fried Chicken Wings w/ Sweet Thai Chili Sauce & the $5.95 pan seared pork Gyoza. The Gyoza was VERY GOOD (see pic), but the Fried Chicken Wings were unimpressive.

The shrimp; squid; crab leg; scallop; fish cake; & fish balls sound just too good not to order. What I found most impressive about Machi is my taste buds were NOT hijacked by a surplus of sodium, as has been my experience w/ Ramen elsewhere.\n\nOh, let us not forget the 17 Additional Toppings diners can add to their Ramen. Seven are just $1 each! The most expensive is the Shrimp @ $5.50. For Fried Tofu lovers, adding it will cost you $2. \n\nService was EXCELLENT; the friendly  young woman greeted me the moment I walked thru the door.

There were two courses to choose from with 18 holes, we went ahead with course 2. None of us are good at mini golf, but had a really fun time.

I was told there was no height requirement for bumper carts and was given inaccurate measurements for the go carts. I called ahead because I did not want to tell my Nephew what I had planned for his bday and get him all excited if he was not tall enough to ride.\n\nAccording to the measurements I received from the employee over the phone, my Nephew was tall enough to ride as a passenger. As you can imagine, this little boy who is obsessed with the movie 'Cars' was beyond excited to be able to ride in a go cart. After taking him to eat and getting him all riled up about the go carts, we arrived to Golf n Stuff where I purchased approximately $40 in ride tickets for him, his Mom and myself as well as an additional $20 in tokens. We hit the bumper boats first, then the go carts. Upon arriving to the front of the line, we were told he was not tall enough. My poor Nephew looked like he was about ready to cry. We tried to make it better by spending more money on tokens for him to play games inside, but he was still very disappointed.\n\nHis Mom went to the front desk to ask for a refund for the tickets where she was told that there is a no refund policy for ride tickets. I then took the tickets to the front desk to ask for a refund where I was also told no. The lady in front of me faced the EXACT same issue we had with her child not being tall enough to ride the go carts. She left the front desk looking defeated. \n\nUpon the arrival of the manager on duty, Lacy, she gave me the same old song and dance as the other team members. I explained to her that I was quoted the wrong measurements over the phone and we were allowed to purchase the tickets without him being measured. Finally, upon asking for the managers and owners contact information, she reluctantly agreed to refund the tickets. Of course, she couldn't just provide said refund courteously with a smile. No, she proceeded to lecture me about how she was doing me such a big favor and that I needed to not make the same mistake the next time. She said that I had bought a lot of ride tickets and insinuated that I looked suspect for returning them.\n\nTruth be told, I have always been partial to Funtasticks. Ever since I was a kid in middle school, I have gone there. Not even as a kid was I treated with any amount of disrespect by their team members, much less now as an adult. The reason I decided on Golf n Stuff was because it was closer to where my Nephew and his Mom live. I'll be sure not to make that same mistake again.\n\nLacy needs some serious coaching on her problem resolution and customer service skills. From what I experienced, she is in no way capable nor should she be trusted to work with customers in resolving their issues. If she treats every customer the way she treated me, I can only imagine how many people she's turned off to Golf n Stuff.\n\nIn conclusion.....go to Funtasticks instead.

There is no point in reviewing a University as it will no doubt turn into a battle of school pride with the winner being chosen based on the number of Yelpers at each school.\n\nBut Alan pointed out the ignorance of some people, so I will share the story behind our school\'s battle cry, ""Bear Down,"" as told by arizonawildcats.com.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Wildcats\' battle cry of ""Bear Down"" comes from the dying words of a popular student-athlete. John ""Button"" Salmon was president of the student body, starting quarterback, and three-year catcher for the baseball team. Nicknamed for his small frame (5\'8"", 145 pounds) and impish good looks, he was very popular with his teammates, coach, and fellow students.\n\nSalmon was also a talented baseball catcher. In the spring of 1925 his clutch two-base hit drove in the winning run against USC. When he was elected student body president a few days later he referred to that hit as ""the 200-vote double.""\n\nThe day after the 1926 season\'s opening game, Salmon was driving with three friends when he missed a treacherous curve and spun over a ravine. Although others were not seriously injured, he suffered a serious spinal cord injury and died on October 18, 1926, at St. Mary\'s Hospital. His final message to his teammates, given to coach McKale, who visited Salmon everyday in the hospital, was ""Tell them...tell the team to bear down.""\n\nAt Salmon\'s funeral service, a three-mile line of cars snaked from downtown Tucson to the cemetery.\n\nA year later the student body voted to make ""Bear Down"" the official slogan of all Wildcat teams and in 1939 the State of Arizona issued a proclamation declaring the phrase ""Bear Down"" to be the sole and exclusive property of the University of Arizona. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo some may think that ""Bear Down"" is the silly thing that proctologists tell men, but it is our battle cry, a battle cry that actually came from somewhere, a battle cry that actually means something.', 'Rah rah red and blue.  \n\nReally?  These are the reviews for UA?\n\nPerhaps the athletic department should have a separate yelp listing?\n\nWhere are the reviews about negligent spending of State funds, misappropriation of funds, disparaging salaries?\n\nNo, this listing is meant to drum up spirit for athletics,  not true quality, and not a true representation of UA.', 'Bear down Arizona. Bear down red and blue. Bear down Arizona. Hit \'em hard, let \'em know who\'s who. Bear down Arizona. Bear down red and blue. Go. Go. Wildcats Go. Arizona bear down! \n\nHow could I not start my review with the best fight song there is? As a graduate from U of A, I am a wildcat through and through and with that comes an unconditional love for the red brick university in the middle of Tucson, Arizona. But, unconditional love aside, people ask me all the time why I chose U of A. Well, I chose it because it\'s different than the other Arizona schools and I fell in love with the campus, the environment, the experience, the weather and the four-year quality education I knew I was going to get.\n\nU of A is a small university hidden behind a very large school. What do I mean? Well, during my time at U of A, I lived on campus three out of four years, and every time I walked through campus, I ran into people I knew. It\'s funny how you can be in the midst of 35,000 U of A students yet always feel at home and amongst family. But, rather than bore you with a biography of my college years, I\'ll cut this review to the basics. \n\nThe Campus: Beautiful. Picture red brick buildings, a quad aka ""the mall"" -- a long and luscious grass area in the middle of campus. A student union full of everything a college student would need so they never need to leave campus... including: a hair salon, a movie theater, endless cafes and restaurants, a post office, a drug store, a convenience store and the state of the art bookstore. Trees line the campus. There are endless study areas throughout campus to do work outside. Or, if you want to study in a library, there are a ton to choose from: the ILC if you want more of a party, the Engineering Library if you really need to cut the crap and get your study on and several others where you can do a little bit of both. \n\nThe living situation: Ok, dorms will be dorms, but in a college environment like U of A, it doesn\'t really matter where you live because you\'re having the time of your life and it\'s pretty easy to forgot about the dorm room that\'s trying to keep you down. Plus, there are a ton of houses, apartments and Greek life housing surrounding campus when it\'s time to say Au revoir to the dorms. \n\nUniversity -- the district not the street: University is the block leading up to campus and full of restaurants, a hotel, bars and boutiques (many of them that were not around when I was in school and I\'m still bitter). It\'s fabulous. Sometimes i wake up to a dream about one of most popular outdoor restaurants in the area and I shed a tear missing it. \n\nEducation: It was top notch. From the basic freshman classes, to my senior thesis classes, I always received a solid education and one that I\'ll always keep with me. I had some of the best teachers, including Dr. Soren who was the most well-traveled and cultural professor I\'d ever met and Dr. Cyrino who was the funniest and smartest teacher of Greek history and made learning fun. I took everything from french class to business math to Roman history. Each class challenged me and left me wanting to get out there and make the most of myself in the world. \n\nAthletics: Wildcat games are the greatest and it\'s not about whether they win or lose. It\'s the school spirit and loyalty that shows throughout the entire campus and city during a game day. From senior citizens to future Wildcats, the fans are true, red and blue. It\'s so fun and social to tailgate on game day and walk through the crowds of other friendly Wildcats. You can feel the school spirit and it\'s hard not to join in the fun. \n\nSince this is my University and one that holds many cherished memories, I will end this review by saying that University of Arizona is a gem in the desert. Anyone who gives it a solid shot falls in love and will bleed red and blue for the rest of their days. All it takes is going back to homecoming and football games year after year to see why everyone should become a Wildcat. \n\nPS: Wildcats know how to party like the best of them.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,

My husband and I couldn't finish it since we also shared the Meatery Board and Marinated Crab Claws but we took it home and had the remainder the next day! Put it in the oven wrapped in foil for 20mins at 350 degrees and it warmed and still moist!\n\nThe Meatery Board is always amazing. There is always something new/different but always good :) you will not regret getting it...unless you don't like good meat\n\nIf you like crab, the marinated crab claws are a must try! They do have a kick of spice to them so eat with caution if you are not susceptible to spicy food. But man is it worth it! We love love love this starter and always get it. The level of acid, salt and spiciness is just perfect!\n\nOur go to order: Meatery board, marinated crab claws, and now double cut pork chop...all of this for two people will for sure be a good meal!

Watching a movie at the Tampa Theatre is not only a treat for the eyes, it's a treat itself because of its history. There's no better place to watch movies, especially thrillers and horrors, than Tampa Theatre. My first visit here was during a marathon of Halloween movies that included Hocus Pocus and Psycho. \n\nAs a historic landmark dating back to 1926, Tampa Theatre's presence is an iconic one in the community. With that instantaneously recognizable vertical sign with TAMPA in big letters, it should be a right of passage for all residents to experience a showing here. \n\nI like that the theatre not only offers new releases but also themed screenings for all occasions such as Halloween. Next month, Tampa Theatre is featuring a marathon of movies from the 80s. \n\nParking can be a hassle and can be very expensive. I suggest getting there early prior to your scheduled screening to find free parking, if possible. Due to an event at Curtis Hixon this past weekend, parking was $15 at the Tampa Theatre lot adjacent to the theatre. \n\nThe screening room is two floors with A LOT of seats. The seats are a little too close to each other and can feel tight, especially being close to other people. I've sat upstairs and downstairs, in the center, and to the left. I have found that good views of the screen are abundant.\n\nWhether you live here or are visiting the Tampa Bay area, the Tampa Theatre is a MUST."", 'I learned from my visits to Denver that watching old classic movies in the summertime at a unique venue can really be enjoyable. \n\nWhile Denver\'s summer classic movie series is at the unbelievable Red Rocks outdoor moutainside concert setting, Tampa does it at the first-ever commercial venue in the city to feature air-conditioning.\n\nTampa Theatre has been around for nearly 90 years and still creates a wonderful atmosphere for something like this.\n\nThe look of the interior is outstanding and I\'ve been in multiple theaters constructed in the last 25 years that are a tighter fit and much less comfortable than this one.\n\nConcessions are reasonably priced and employees are happy to welcome you.\n\nSeriously, Back to the Future is on some cable channel every day. Yet, myself, friends and a capacity crowd gladly handed over $10 per person to watch it on a Sunday afternoon here.\n\nOh, and the resolution and clarity of the film was as good on their big screen as if I was enjoying Marty, Doc and Biff run around in HD at home. No complaints about the sound quality either.\n\nThe pre-show organist is a classic touch and while I did not stay for the Q & A that followed, I appreciate how Tampa Theatre makes these movies a unique experience. \n\nJust wish the creative group sitting right up near the stage had brought more of those ""SAVE THE HILL VALLEY CLOCK TOWER"" flyers and handed them out to all of us. Nicely done, guys. For many years now, I actually have a broken clock in my home set to 10:04 in honor of this great movie.', 'So I come from L.A., and have an affinity for old cinemas.  In a world of stadium cinemas, reclining seats with cup holders and waiters coming to your seat (all awesome, of course), it is really cool to get back to basics.\n\nWe used to LOVE going to El Capitan in Hollywood, or some of the other historic places of yesteryear, so when we discovered the Tampa Theatre, I looked at some pictures, and really wanted to check it out.   A it turns out, ""It\'s a Wonderful Life"" was playing, so what better way to transport yourself back to the 40\'s?\n\n- Low-back uncomfortable red velvet chairs - Check!\n- Pray the person in front of you is short:  Check!\n- Very Little room to stretch your legs:  Check!\n- Small screen without ultramodern digital sound - Check!\n\n(All of these may seem negative, but they are a part of bringing me back to another time, so I LOVED it)\n\n- Ornate interior surrounding the screen - Check!\n\n- Wurlitzer Organ player rising from below the stage to entertain us before the movie - CHECK\n\n- A feeling as you walk in that you are walking into history, and an experience rather than just a film - Check!\n\nAll of the qualities of the old-time Hollywood cinemas hat I grew up with are there, and seeing a 1940\'s black and white movie in that atmosphere made for an amazing time travel experience.\n\nI can\'t wait to get back again.

We booked our tour online and wanted to do the Voodoo tour and Cemetery tour and were able to book these together. The tour started at 2 PM and we arrived a little early. After we arrived and we were waiting for the tour to start I noticed one of the tour guides walking up had purple hair and a big black coat on! I knew that was the tour guide we wanted. We were split into two groups since it was a busy day and off we went with our tour guide which I believe her name was Anna! \n\nAnna started out by telling us a little bit about her. She grew up, went to college and then studied her masters and doctorate at UC Berkley in Anthropology. She moved to Africa to do Anthropology and while there she learned a lot about Voodoo since that is where some of the religion started.  She was amazing and gave us a complete history of Voodoo and talked about how it got started and how it got to New Orleans. \n\nWe then went to St. Louis Cemetery. This is a cemetery where you have to have a guide at. She signed us into the cemetery and walked us around and showed us different peoples graves. We saw Charles Laveau's tomb, learned about the barring process in NOLA and saw the final resting place and tomb of Nicholas Cage. We then went to see the tomb of Marie Laveau one of the most famous voodoo queens. \n\nAfter a quick bathroom break we went over to Congo square where voodoo started in New Orleans. This was a free space where you could go an practice your religion. If it was not for the Haitian Revolution voodoo would most likely have not made it into the US and we learned that here. The next stop was the home of Marie LaVeau and we got the whole story of the voodoo queen. Finally we ended the tour at a shop that has voodoo stuff inside. We learned how voodoo is something that helps people and it is medicinal.  Anna was an amazing tour guide and did a wonderful job and I would highly recommend these tours!"", 'If you can get him, Sean (Shaun) Bird is the absolute BEST Ghost Adventure Tour Guide you can get (if you want NOLA\'s TRUE HISTORY).\n\nHe\'s a great tour guide for a few reasons. First, he moved to NOLA not really believing in haunting or ghosts and such. Once that changed for him (experiencing spooky stuffs in the former slave\'s quarter he rented), he became obsessed with the history of NOLA.  He\'s researched it thoroughly - I know, because I fact checked a few of the things he mentioned during our tour and he was 100% right. \n\nAnyway, he\'s super friendly and knowledgeable.  He\'s also very courteous to fellow tour guides and guests of the city.  He\'ll have everyone stand in certain places so not to disturb other foot traffic and he\'ll point out some great spots for you. \n\nAgain, he\'s all about the TRUE history of NOLA. So like, he\'ll tell you that there were no vampires in NOLA, but he\'ll tell you why the people THOUGHT there were during a period of time in NOLA (so yeah, don\'t waste your money on the ""Vampire Tour""). He really was an awesome guide. \n\nI took my six year old on the tour, so if you\'ve got little ones, don\'t worry about them being too spooked on the tour, they\'ll do just fine (though a LOT of walking is involved, so maybe a stroller or something? IDK, you do you).', 'My husband had gone on a ghost tour in New Orleans when we visited back in 2012. We decided to use a different company so that is why we booked with New Orleans Ghost Adventure. \n\nWe were a little concerned with the amount of people but they basically divided us up between two guides. \n\nDuring the tour I did do some fact checking and took tons of photos.

After one dining experience I know that I do not intend on dining here again. Aside from the fact that their food is not very fresh (this I gathered from the clear view into the kitchen that one gets as they place their order at the kitchen) there is zero customer service. I walked in with a group of friends after deciding that being on a wait list at Lindys wasn\'t worth it and based on the recommendations I was excited to give it a shot. Epic fail. Walk into the bar and awesomely and nicely present myself to the bartender and told her how excited I was to try the food (her response was ""yeah, it\'s super awesome!), grab a few menus and sit down at a booth with my friends....about five minutes later...no server, no water....the basics.

The sound from the stage is clear and loud - no cavernous reverb muddies the music in the smallish band area. An oddly-placed pool table limits the view of the band from the general area of the large bar, and the Wench is not without design flaws, but the kind, mostly female bar staff whip up strong cocktails with broad strokes instead of pointilist precision which are not for the faint of heart. \n     Its age alone qualifies the Wench for epic divehood, but the music at this venue is anything but old and tired.

Sabrina was kind enough to pack us up a slice of their heavenly mud pie for the road. Heavenly is an accurate depiction of their mid pie. We will definitely be back to try their long list of amazing pizza options."", 'Best pizza in Boise, with amazing staff, an amazing view, and a fantastic patio.  My husband actually just said, ""this is the best sausage I\'ve ever had on a pizza, and I\'m serious"".  Great beers on tap, nice wine list, local business = I\'m sold.', 'Hilltop Station is a ""last stop"" kinda place right at the top of a large hill (naturally) as you make your way towards Idaho City. Built right beside a liquor store, it\'s the perfect place to pick up a bite, load up on firewood and whiskey, and then continue making your way towards the campsites not too much farther ahead.\n\nThis is a bit out of the way for a typical pizza lover, but it\'s the perfect place to make that final stop before forsaking society, I mean...where else can you go? So, as always our question is: is the pizza worth it?\n\nThe interior of this place is, simply put: amazing. Really cool decoration, they\'ve done a fantastic job. Wood and iron everywhere, and old-fashioned kind of knick-knacks in choice places. A modern television set is the only break in what feels like a good ol\' cabin-in-the-woods (or more of a resort lodge). On it plays the black-and-white and technicolor classics. ""Lilies of the Field"" played during our particular visit. We were joined by my girlfriend, and my friend Josh. We ordered a pair of pretzels, a large pepperoni, and a small ""perfect pesto."" The woman who took our order was really cool, the service was great.\n\nAt about 10 minutes, we got our pretzels, and another 5 to 10 after that we got our pizza. Here are the results:\n\n-Pretzels-\nThese are awesome. Doughy, but not under-cooked. Salted, but with genuine rock salt, not that cheap crap you get at a food stand. And it\'s not overloaded with it, either. They offer nacho cheese to dip in, and their own signature mustard. I would highly recommend these to anyone, in fact, I might even recommend the trip out for the pretzels alone.\n\n-Perfect Pesto-\nThis is a pesto base topped with  chicken, canadian bacon, bell pepper, sun-dried tomato and green onion. The flavor kinda came together like a ""lite"" combo pizza. Honestly? Kinda dry, and the pesto was underwhelming. Kenny mentioned the toppings gave him a reminiscence of Cup Noodle ingredients. That sounds harsh, but, I can\'t say it was bad, just kinda bland and forgettable.\n\n-Pepperoni-\nThis was good. Not great. Right in the middle, where the pepperonis are ""correct,"" and the sauce is ""correct,"" and the crust is, ""right."" The crust actually might have been the most unique aspect, giving us a nice taste, but, still nothing special. All around just kind of ""okay.""\n\n-The Verdict-\nHilltop Station has a lot of good things to offer. If we were judging them on their restaurant style and staff attitude alone, they\'d be getting a perfect score. The same could be said of those pretzels. However, when we star our reviews, what we are star-ing is the pizza. In this aspect, Hilltop kind of let us down. I would love to stop here again on my way down this highway in the future, but I\'d go for a pretzel and maybe try a burger before coming back for the pizza. Recommended for anyone traveling towards or from Idaho City, no matter what you get. But if it\'s a budgeting choice between a rack of pretzels and a pizza: you know where we stand.\n\n3 slices out of 5']",0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,1.0,30.0

For twenty bucks each of us had Cubans to take with us and were beyond full walking out the door. I ordered the omelet with chorizo, bacon, Swiss and American cheese, onions and peppers. Just... goodness in egg form, I tell ya.. Just the right amount of everything. No ingredient overpowered another. You tasted everything in every bite. I was so impressed by this omelet.

I will say, however, there only appeared to be 1 server for the entire place at lunch and it filled up quickly. Took a little bit of a wait for him to get our orders, but after that okay.\n\nAnyway, big whopping slices of pizza. And my sausage calzone was tasty. Oozing with cheese and baked perfectly brown. The sausage was a little bland, but otherwise good.\n\nNow ... as for deep dish. When I go there in the evenings, I always get a pepperoni deep dish. SO good.  Now, I'm originally from the Chicago suburbs, and while this isn't exactly the way deep dish is served at home, it gets the job done when you have a craving for it. And their salads are SO good here.

I informed her that would be fine, but she did try and put us in a more quieter room (Luckily it was not needed).\n\nWe checked in rather late, I think around 11pm or so since we had went and got a couple of tattoos and the place was poppin.  Luckily an employee got me to the front desk to check in, supplying me with a key for our room... an actual key not a key card and was sure to let me know not to lose it, lol.

We got our bags to our room, and then got a little refreshed to party.\n\nOn the back patio area they had a Latin DJ accompanied by a steel instrument crew, and they were rocking.  We went to the bar and grabbed some drinks, and though I love to dance I needed to loosen up a bit.

I declared to my husband that ""We are going to party like college students that don\'t have any student loan debt"", and  that we did.  We drank & danced until the club closed, and had the greatest time.  I haven\'t been to a club in sometime so I was in rare form, and danced every opportunity I got.  Everyone was pretty friendly so it made for a great atmosphere and we had a great time. I went back to the same bartender for all of our drinks, and she was really sweet and did a wonderful job (especially dealing with college students, lol).  \n\nWe slept a few hours in our room, it isn\'t anything fancy but that is exactly what I was told it would be.

I have no idea why my experience is so different than other people\'s, but so be it.  Here goes:\n\n(this is for the downstairs entertainment area, not the hotel rooms)\n\nA year ago, I visited for the first time right after moving to Tucson.  I had great drinks, talked to great locals, and saw this awesome Johnny Cash tribute band in the indoor venue downstairs.

Theme nights are fine, but I swear this is always happening when I try to just go for a beer.  The ground floor is in lockdown all evening, and my simple beer won\'t happen unless I pay a cover charge and endure ironically dressed people.\n\n3) Unfriendly regulars.  Outdoor tables are scarce, and not once have I been offered an extra seat at a table.  I know it seems wrong to blame a venue for this, but it\'s happened so many times it seems to be some kind of collective thing the regulars perpetuate.\n\n4) Super-unfriendly regular.  Tonight this guy walked right up to the chair I\'d just sat down in outside.  It seemed like an empty area, and no one said it was taken.   But he just stood in front of me and stared until I uncomfortably got up.  He condescendingly said ""Thank you"" and took the chair without another word.  Again, not the venue\'s fault per se, but why on earth could this not have gone down one of a dozen alternate, more congenial ways?\n\n5) Boorish regular.  People drink, people socialize, some people get boisterous.  Sure!  But tonight, in what was already a deteriorating experience there, some fellow went into a smug self-important rant about Celtic drums, fifes and stuff, yelling about it to some other random dude.  It was the kind of voice you couldn\'t not hear, and it was irritating.\n\n6) Margaritas are worse every time I go.  They\'re hand mixed, but over this last year I\'ve seen this place lose touch with the recipe.  Tonight\'s was watery, bitter, and still as expensive as always.\n\n7) Hipsters?  I keep reading this place is a ""hipster"" hangout.  I really don\'t know what a hipster is precisely, but if they are smug, ironic, self-important, and can\'t tell what a decent alcoholic beverage tastes like -- then yes, maybe this is a hipster hangout after all.\n\nThat is all.  I don\'t like writing negative reviews, especially about local venues.  But I\'ve had it with this place and had to air this out.  I hope you fare better if you go.']",0.75,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.0,1.0,30.0

I ate at Milkfish years ago when they were open, and I was pretty disappointed. After they had closed down, I thought there were no more Filipino restaurants left in NOLA! I was curious one day and decided to check Yelp for some Filipino restaurants that may exist around the city. I found this place and I was shocked at the fact that I never even heard of this place before!\n\nCame with a party of 6, two of them being little children. A waitress told us to have a seat anywhere and we saw a menu on chalkboards. We had no idea what anything was, but there were some English ingredients in parenthesis. We ordered the Lumpiang Shanhai, Crispy Pata, Kare-Kare, Pancit without Vegetables, Tokwat Baboy, and Halo-Halo.\n\nThe restaurant looks like it used to be a corner store, but they converted it to be a restaurant. It still has the same layout and everything, but with some tables and chairs. It does look a bit rundown, but don't let that deter you from getting some really good food! It was a bit unsettling to walk through the kitchen to get to the restroom, but at least they had one for customers. \n\nFood took a while to come out, because I think it was a one man show in the kitchen. The Lumpiang Shanhai appetizers came out first and were like thin and long egg rolls, which were placed on a bed of lettuce and came with sweet chili sauce. Wrapping them with the lettuce and dipping in sweet chili sauce made a perfect dish! The entrees came afterwards, and everything looked really unique. It felt like we were invited to a Filipino household and fed traditional food, it was really special. I could tell that the food took time and love to make!\n\nThe server came with bowls of rice for the entrees to complete the meal. The Crispy Pata was a large roasted pork thigh on a bed of lettuce with some sauce and mango on the side. The crispiness and flavor was all on point! The mango was there to balance everything out. The Kare Kare was like a unique curry with oxtail, with extravagant flavors and vegetables. The Tokwat Baboy was a truly unique dish with both savory and sour flavors. It featured savory pork belly and tofu, cooked in a light and lemony sauce with assorted vegetables. I loved the ingredients for the dish, but not too big of a fan of the sauce. That being said, I probably still ate most of the dish in my party. I can't really talk much about the pancit, because they were made without vegetables for the kids. It seemed like a Filipino version of a Pad Thai. In the end, my favorite entrées were probably the Tokwat Baboy and Crispy Pata! \n\nMy group was pretty full and we were forcing ourselves to finish everything, but we really wanted to try out the Halo-Halo for dessert. It was a shaved ice dessert topped with Ube ice cream, flan, and Ube custard.  We didn't know how to eat it, so the server told us that it is supposed to be stirred and then eaten. It was an absolutely delicious dessert! The flan really stood out to me, I wish we could have ordered the flan along with the halo-halo.\n\nOverall, it was a unique and different cuisine to experience! The food was delicious, and the staff were great! My group loved the experience we had here and I can't wait to be back to try more dishes!"", 'A hidden Filipino gem in New Orleans.

Visited CK's with four girlfriends and we arrived HUNGRY.  We immediately ordered lumpia, and then ordered another round. As my friend described, they're like potato chips-- so addicting and you can't eat just one!  We also put in an order for the crispy pata and some pancit (see my previous review for how good those were) as well as the Sisig and the Tokwa't Baboy.  My goodness, the feast that ensued.  The pata and Pancit were just as good as I remembered (again, check the previous review for descriptions) and I was psyched for two new dishes.  The Sisig, a dish made from pig head, was a chopped dish combining pork, onion, what tasted like potato, peppers, and a raw egg, served on a sizzling plate.  It was served with mayonnaise, but I skipped out since I'm not a fan of mayo.  The Tokwa't was a mix of pig ear, pork belly, and firm tofu cooked and then tossed with red onion and a vinegary sauce-- definitely a new favorite!! \n\nWe eventually finished most of the dishes, and though we were SO FULL we ordered a single leche flan and an order of Halo Halo (!!!-see first review) because we are masochists.  The leche flan was so creamy and delicious-- not to mention HUGE, but oh so good.  And the halo halo.  Just what I was craving before my last review: ube and taro ice cream, an extra slice of leche flan, beans, jello, pandan, and so many other things all mixed together in one glass.  Amazing!

My date and I arrived and were greeted by the two wonderful bartenders on the bottom floor who could not have been nicer and more welcoming. Each time I came back to the bar they were right there to see if we needed anything. We drank at the downstairs bar for 90 percent of the night. Then it all fell apart due to the most incompetent and rude manager I have ever had to deal with. \nWe closed our tab at the downstairs bar total of $80.0 for the tab plus a $25.00 tip for the outstanding service of the girls downstairs. \nWe go upstairs to have one more drink before leaving and after the drink I ask for my tab and to pay out...the upstairs bartenders says ""There is a $20.00 minimum on a credit card you have to order more drinks or pay the difference in cash."" I explained that we had just closed a $100 tab downstairs which put us well above the $20.00 minimum...the bartender says "" I don\'t care what you spend downstairs it\'s a 20.00 minimum and refused to give me back my license and credit card. I asked to speak to a manager and the Fema Nazi from hell appeared out of the mist to ""address"" my issues. She started off with an attitude without even asking what was wrong. After I explained to her that I was not going to pay another $15.00 dollars to get my credit card back she went saying that there is a $20.00 minimum on credit cards...I explained to this moron that I had already spent over $100 downstairs which was well over the $20.00 minimum...I asked her to show me a sign anywhere near the bar that stated there was a $20.00 minimum which she was unable to do as there is no sign anywhere inside the bar. After arguing with this rude, obnoxious and completely unprofessional ""manager"" my tab was waived and we went to leave moments later.  As we were walking out the front exit  the Fema Nazi appeared again and proceeded to say see here is the sign about the 20.00 minimum which is about a 3-inch sign on the darkened entry door that you could not see if you tried. I again explained that I spent over $100 in the bar informed her that maybe they should update their point of sale systems so the bottom floor bars and the top floor know someone had already paid their tab above their minimum. She then proceeded to flip-out as How Dare I a simple peasant tell her how to run her bar.  My family has been in the bar business for 40 years so I think I have a bit of knowledge in that area. She then pointed to the door girl and said these two are banned. So a fantastic night which was going perfect was ruined by a horribly incompetent ""manager"" who has no clue how to treat a customer.  Needless to say banned or not I will not be going back until the owners replace this lousy excuse of a manager with someone that understands customer service.   \n\n1 star for the manager....5 stars for the fantastic service of the young ladies working the bottom bar...maybe the manager can spend 2 minutes with these ladies to see how you treat a customer.', 'Came back to edit my 4am review...Came here last night (saturday 10/16).

Anne Rice is another favorite public figure of mine and I thought it was refreshing to see where up close must she have grown up in.

I was initially sad to see the Lodge close. I really enjoyed the Lodge's sushi roll special on Wednesdays and their late night party atmosphere with red led lighting. The Luv Child brings an old 1970's vintage vibe with amber or yellow lighting, circular drop down lights similar to On Swann and M Bird, comfy vintage booth seating on the right side of the restaurant, vintage 70s disco music, and a gold disco ball. I'm really not a huge fan of the yellow lighting but it is something different and at least not crazy bright. On the Luv Child's patio, there is purple lighting which I much prefer over the yellow lighting. \n\nLuv Child serves combo plates, tacos, tortillas, sandwiches, and salads with your choice of shredded ahi verde chicken, Lima polla frita, herb marinated chicken thigh, orange mojo shredded pork, roasted pork ropa vieja, chimichurri toasted pork, grilled carne asada steak, grilled sustainable salmon, chickpea Rojas, toasted nacho mushrooms, and impossible burger beef. \n\nI got the chimichurri roasted pork, roasted pork ropa vieja, orange mojo shredded pork, and grilled carne asada steak tacos served with onions, cilantro, jalapeño, and home-made guac on a soft flour tortillas. All the tacos were pretty tasty! I really liked the unique and tasty meat marinades Luv Child chose!\n\nMy friend got the kale & shaved Brussels salad with grilled salmon, grape tomatoes, plantain croutons, Parmesan & lime Caesar and was pretty please as well. \n\nTo drink we got the frozen traditional margarita, frozen strawberry margarita, the Aguila cerveza pale ale from Barranquilla, Columbia, and Paul Chenau's Lady of Spain Cava Spanish Sparkling Wine. The frozen margaritas were very tasty and quite potent! Drinks are a little on the pricey side but the food is pretty reasonably priced so it balances out. I was impressed that Luv Child had quite a large imported wine selection from Spain, Chile, Portugal, & Argentina and quite a large imported brew selection from Cuba, Columbia, Belgium, Italy, Mexico, and the Netherlands. \n\nStarting the week of Nov 19th, Happy Hour will be 3pm - 630pm on weekdays. On Tuesdays, Luv Child will serve  $2 cubano tacos on Tuesdays. On Wednesday's, ladies get $3 strawberry mojitos, dragonfruit margaritas, white rose sangria, and glasses of rose wines. On weekends during brunch, Luv Child will serve $3 Palomas and Mimosas. On Sundays, hospitality gets 50 percent off food, and 25 percent off mixed drinks. \n\nOur server was pretty friendly and knowledgeable in recommending items on the menu. It did take awhile to get seated because the place is new and very busy. It took about 10 minutes to order and another 10 minutes to get food which isn't bad. The kitchen brings out all the tacos individually instead of all together which is a little different but I didn't mind. I look forward to coming back soon and trying more of the meat options for taco Tuesday, more of the imported brews, and more of the frozen drink options soon!"", ""Came for happy hour which is 3-6:30 everyday.

The entrees (which I was too full and didn't order) were huge. I tried my friends chicken and rice burrito with some kind of avocado cream on it that was heavenly. The yucca fries were cooked well and came with two dipping sauces, one green one that was kind of spicy and a grayish one that was my fav, it tasted like kalamata olives.

You're able to pick your proteins so we picked a chicken and pork. After 3pm, you pick two proteins. There's a whole bunch of options besides what we chose such as chick peas, mushrooms, and plant based chorizo. \n\nThey have regular tacos and paratha tacos too, and you choose your proteins as well. I say go for the paratha tacos if either of those cross your mind.\n\nThis is a Cuban fusion restaurant with lots of fun and pizzazz. They also have happy hour with bites and drink specials in the afternoon after 3 til like 6 ish.  The nachos and, fried yuca, and wings were super popular.\n\nDefinitely check Luv Child out!! It's a blast!!!

There are three floors of permanent and temporary exhibition galleries highlighting 12,000 years of Florida's history. The highlights for me were the following. \n\n1. The Touchton Map Library. It is the only cartographic center in the southeastern United States and has over 8,000 original maps, charts and other documents dating back to the discovery of the New World. Very interesting! \n\n2. The presentation of the Seminole Wars\nfrom 1817-1858 and the Seminole warrior Coacoochee\xa0 was great with really cool special effects. The exhibit explores how African slaves worked with the Seminoles to protect the land. Really enlightening! \n\n3. I most enjoyed Treasure Seekers! You learn about pirates and privateers including thier unique form of democracy. This included the interactive\nPirates Fate\xa0 which is an 8-minute action-packed\xa0 inmersion\xa0 on the high seas with Pirates Jack Rackham and Anne Bonny. This is based on two real-life Buccaneers who sailed the Caribbean in search of plunder in the early 18th century.

I manned the canon and picked which direction to sail.\xa0Let me tell you, when the need arose,\xa0 I did not hesitate to fire that cannon and steal the booty!! Very fun! \n\nTerry Zitek was our guide and he did an incredible job!  We had a great time. You can really spend all day here!"", 'The Tampa Bay History Center has quickly become my favorite museum on this side of the Bay, and it is a great place to spend the afternoon. The History Museum is located in a 3-story building right alongside the waterfront, and behind the Amilie Arena (AKA Tampa Bay Times Forum). The easiest way to get to the museum is to drive across Old Water Street, directly in front of the big Marriott and the Arena, and then follow the signs back around to the museum. There is a parking lot immediately adjacent to the museum, and the cost of parking is included with your admission fee.\n\nFor those who want to get out and take a stroll, you can easily reach the museum by parking your car in Channelside, or near the Convention Center, and then following the Riverwalk. The Tampa Bay History Center faces Harbour Island, and you can sit on their outside terrace at one of the umbrella-shaded tables and enjoy something to eat or drink in the fresh air.\n\nI started my afternoon at the History Center with a stop at the indoor location of the Columbia Café for a 1905 salad and a cup of their very delicious Spanish Bean soup. My high-top table overlooked the Riverwalk, as well as gave me a view of their spectacular hand-carved wooden bar. WOW!\n\nAfter lunch it was time to start exploring. The second level of the building is the first story of the museum, so after paying your admission it\'s through the doors and time to step back into history. Your self-guided tour begins with a look at Florida\'s first people -- the indigenous tribes of native Americans who had settled in our State. There\'s a very good movie which portrays the Spanish landing in the New World, and their interactions with the Indians.\n\nWalking along past the exhibits, you\'ll be transported back to the days of the Seminole and Miccosukee Indians, and learn about their daily lives -- hunting, fishing, simple agricultural tasks, making baskets, and weaving blankets -- quite an idyllic life. As you walk through time you\'ll see more about the European explorers and learn about their less-than-stellar interactions with the natives. The need to conquer land for the Queen and search for gold seemed to far outweigh our ancestors\' common sense. There\'s a lot of information about the various Indian Wars, and the story of the famous chief Coacoochee.\n\nNext up is the story of tobacco, the Cuban immigration to Florida, and the development of the cigar industry in Ybor City -- leading to Tampa\'s nickname of ""Cigar City"". Very interesting displays about the cigar factories and the life of a cigar roller.\n\nUp the stairs and the timeline brings us to the time of the Florida cow herders and crackers. (The term ""cracker"" refers to cracking the tip of leather whip in mid-air as they made the cattle mosey along.) You\'ll learn about life on the cattle ranches in the center part of our state. From there you\'ll spot the exhibit about Florida\'s citrus industry, and hear the story of growing, picking, packing, and shipping oranges, grapefruit, and more.\n\nTampa\'s history moves along quickly with stories about Italian immigrants and organized crime invading Ybor City, and living alongside the Cubans. You\'ll learn about the importance of the military in our region and hear stories of soldiers from the various wars. There\'s a great exhibit about the history of the Gasparilla Pirate Invasion, the impact of professional sports on the Bay area, and the development of the Tampa Port to enhance commercial trade. All sorts of little tidbits of history which kept me entertained for hours.\n\nThe tour finished up in the map gallery where you can visually see the development of various cities and towns in Central Florida through the changes in their city maps.\n\nI was very impressed by the quality and the diversity of information shown in this museum, and will definitely be back. If you\'re a history buff then you might want to consider an annual membership which includes free admission, regular newsletters, and access to lectures and special events.', ""We've been to the Tampa Bay History Center several times, for different exhibits and functions. We've always been impressed. It has a beautiful location, on the Riverwalk, between the Aquarium and Amalie Arena. You can walk to it from either location, or take the Tampa Electric Trolley from Downtown or Ybor City or parts in between.\n\nThe static exhibits are the discovery of Florida, with an engaging film when you first enter. As you move through each floor, you can explore the history of Tampa, and the individual influences contributing to its present: the Seminole Indians, cigar making, sports, the wars, and more. The visiting exhibit for now concerns fossils and artifacts. \n\nWe enjoyed the interactive film about pirates, as well as the exhibit surrounding it. The pirate ship is HUGE! We also enjoyed visiting the replica of the cigar shop, and the room where workers made cigars. We did not ride on the saddles provided to watch the cattle ranching film, but we were tempted.

The Cabildo was the site of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, which doubled the size of the United States. Fr 1803 to 1853, it was the site of the Louisiana government.

But that\'s the only way.\n\nMy tire light had been coming on every week or two, which would result in me feeling up each tire with air until the light went back off. I wasn\'t even sure which tire it was. So after it came on again, I took it to a tire shop near my house and the guy identified the problem tire and said the tread was too low to patch it, so it would cost me about $100 for a new one. He also said that it would be about 2.5 hours before they could have it ready. That just felt a bit off to me, so I went to get a 2nd opinion at Discount Tire Town since they had such amazing reviews.\n\nHere\'s how that played out:\n\nI pulled up, gave them the story and they started checking the pressure of each tire.

I love Yelp! It\'s helped me find amazing places like this and amazing people like you! \n\nHappy Hour 5/5\nHealthy Choices 4/5 (based on happy hour menu only) \nBar 5/5 EASY!\nSeating 3/5\nlocation 5/5\nPrice 4/5\nOverall diversity and comfort level 5/5\n\nWow! What a good time! I\'ve been wanting to try this place for some time and tonight I finally did! Yay! I\'m a SUPER fan and will visit again soon, tomorrow perhaps?!?\n\nWalking in, I was nervous because I didn\'t have reservations and I looked at other reviews on Yelp using the keyword ""Happy hour"" and it was very clear that I needed reservations. I walked in about 5 pm and I was the only person there, which allowed me to look around and take some photos. Beautiful-- period. Shortly thereafter the people rolled in, and rolled in, which was an ah ha moment! Get there early! The crowd was all over the place, which as a sociologist I loved. People are beautiful and amaze me! This is a smaller establishment and they do their best with space. Look up at the fans--- never seen that before (look at my video). \n\nBeing a single dad of 4 I\'ve recently learned that Happy Hour is a way to get what you want, and pay half the price and Mai Thai didn\'t disappoint. \nThe waiter was very nice, knowledgeable, and receptive. \n\nHappy Hour is 1/2 price apps and BOGO drinks! You must sit in the bar area for Happy Hour, but there are over 10 tables, one booth and ample seating at the actual bar. You just can\'t sit in the dining room. \n\nThis is what we ordered:\n\nPortobello Tempura Mushrooms ($6 happy hour $12 regular) A++ \nHuge chunks of Mushroom tempura covered and fried. Served with Sweet Soy sauce. Epic!\n\nCalifornia Roll--  ($5 HH $10 reg) These rolls were wrapped very tightly and big chunks with quality ingredients-- another A+ Ordered two of them! Classic Kani and avocado roll with sesame and cucumber. \n\nThai Chicken Satay\'s with a peanut sauce ($6 HH $12 reg.) 3/5-- not my favorite, but good nevertheless. \n_________________________________________________________\n********* DRINKS************\nFull bar-- bartenders are true mixologists! Their menu has lots of signature drinks and lots of different expirimental drinks. \nAgain, BOGO. I ordered:\n\nFirst was Spiced & Iced-- Markers Mark, Averna, Amarula, Thai Chili Honey, Mint, Thai Iced Coffee and vanilla whip. This was really good, but has a little spice to it, which is good-- just beware. \n\nShould I get another? Of course, I should because it\'s free! BOGO ... \nI couldn\'t decide between the house Mai Thai or the or the smoke show. I asked the waiter and he was 100% invested in the smoke show, which is: Bulleit, rye, Benedictine, Peychaud, burnt pineapple, with baked pinecone smoke. When it was brought over you could smell the smokiness... mmmm it was good n strong. \n\nWell, thanks for reading. I hope you get to enjoy Mai Thai and have the most amazing day ever! Thanks for reading!', '2nd visit in one week-- downgraded to 4 stars. \nI made a reservation for 10 pm and in the special instructions, I requested seating at the bar so that we can enjoy the late night happy hour. I got a call at 8:45 pm and was told that reservations can\'t be held for the bar or happy hour. I get it, but at least allow us to sit in the dining room... \n\nI went there anyway and sat at the bar with 4 friends. It was hard to talk to them. The dining room, 5 feet away, was nearly empty. \n\nAdditionally, I took a sip of my partner\'s drink and the bartender told me they would have to charge us separately next time as there is no sharing, the BOGO drinks are per person-- I get that, too, but it was a drink-- I didn\'t take a whole glass...  \n\nLastly, you can\'t use the 10% check-in offer on happy hour. Again, another thing that I understand, but they really should list that. \n\nSo, 2nd time wasn\'t as good as the first. However, I understand all of the ""rules"" they aren\'t necessarily ""customer"" focused. \n\nI wanted to bring attention to their Buffet. This is taken from their website: It includes a rotating menu of fresh-cooked items but always includes stir fries, noodles dishes, rice dishes, curries, vegetarian entrées, sushi, soup, appetizers, and salad. All of this for $11.99!', 'This is a great spot for bigger groups! Vegan, vegetarians, and omnivores all have great options here! We had a reservation for 6 and they sat our party in their back room, very private with a cool vibe! I would book again for any other type of big work, family, or friend dinner! \nWhile at Mai Thai\'s, we had to get the Mai Tai! Very delicious and in a really cute tiki cup. Sooo good, I think almost everyone at our table (including me) had two of them. \nThe vegan in our group ordered the Verisoy Thai Basil Pad Kra Pao. Our server noted ""I know it looks like chicken but I swear it\'s not!"" when they brought it over. This dish is also Gluten Free! In Boise, a GF Vegan option is hard to come by so if you\'ve got hard dietary restrictions this is your best bet. \nWe also ordered the Drunken Noodles- Phat Khi Mao. This dish is GF and you can add any sort of protein, and we ordered it with chicken. All good stuff! \nI ordered the papaya salad, which came with a side of their sticky rice! It was fresh and very yummy. My only issue was that there were large chunks of garlic and whole green thai chilies. The thing with the thai chilies is that there were also little green beans in this dish, and I bit into a thai chili thinking it was a green bean. I had to spit it out in front of some work colleagues, I felt very rude doing so but everyone was obviously understanding. \nI would honestly order the papaya salad again, regardless of this chili and whole garlic incident because other than that it was really good!']",0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,1.0,30.0

This place is absolutely amazing!!  I hesitated to write this review because it seems like they are getting a lot of attention and I want them to succeed but I also still want to be able to get my nails done.  Anyway if they continue running their business the way I saw them when I went there is no need to worry.  \nAfter not being able to get in to my regular nail place -  at the last minute on a Saturday - I started looking around for what I thought would be a temporary one time visit somewhere else.  I just got back into town and desperately needed a mani/pedi otherwise I wouldn't have even bothered.  I found a few places on here and for some reason this one caught my eye even though it was the furthest one from me.  I called them up and asked for an appointment later in the day and the woman, might've been the owner, immediately said yes but then asked if I wanted to come in right then instead. Yes!  I showed up to the salon and took one of the few seats open, questioning why the woman would have asked me to come in then when they were clearly busy.  Eventually  the same lady came over and when I told her what I needed she asked if I had called and then quickly got me a pedicure chair ready.  She essentially is like a hostess at her shop and keeps everyone moving in a pretty smooth motion.  She greets everyone warmly, guides them to choose colors and chairs and circles around to see who she can move next, takes payments and again gives a friendly goodbye and starts all over.  She checked in a couple of times to see how my pedicure was going and then to comment on my mani color.  Very impressive!  \nAs if that wasn't enough, I would easily pay double their very reasonable prices for that pedicure alone!!  Even in that bustling atmosphere it was so relaxing and just mesmerizing.  There's a soak, scrubs, hot towels, massage - the works!  I opted for the basic gel mani/pedi combo but now I can't wait to go back and see what the deluxe version offers.  The employees all worked at a steady pace and although there were people coming and going constantly you never feel rushed, the scrubs and massages are thorough and the color is flawless.  I am not one to jump around from salon to salon, I like to find a place I enjoy and stick with it and while I have frequented my favorite place for a few years now they have unfortunately gotten more popular without the staff to support them so it is harder and harder to get an appointment and walk-ins are no longer an option.  This salon has plenty of staff plus did I mention the pedicure??!  I think I found a new spot."", ""First time coming here visiting in town and I'm impressed! Booked with Pam (owner) for a full set because of all her reviews. I wanted a reverse french ombré, and I'm pretty sure she questioned why I wanted white at the bottom instead of pink but I wanted to try it out. I was very pleased with how it came out! She constantly asked me if I liked each step she was doing, always saying that if I'm happy, she's happy. \n\nThe salon was very busy but Pam never failed to make sure everyone had a good experience and no wait time."", ""I really enjoy this place. The staff is so friendly and they're reasonably priced. They do a hot stone pedicure for $25 and every time I have gone its been great. Their gel manicures are also $25.

Cake has to be really really good to tickle my fancy, so the fact that these cupcakes are about half frosting really appeals to me. I have to be honest, I don't buy dessert that often. I have surprisingly strong willpower when I have to purchase something sweet. At home, where I have a ton of sugar, I have no willpower (I've already taken a break from writing this review to eat two types of Ben and Jerry's Ice cream and Ghirardelli chocolate). Now that I've tried these cupcakes, I'm pretty screwed, because they were a solid hit for me and I see myself returning every time I'm in the area.\n\nI love that they have mini cupcakes and they are probably better for my waistline, but when I get dessert I go big so the normal sized cupcakes are for me. I did try the mini version of the red velvet and it was great. However, my love is reserved for the salted caramel cupcake. Holy mackerel was it amazing. Warning, it will give you diabetes, immediately. \n\nI love the combination of salt and sweet. If you don't love (like really love) sweet things, do not get the salted caramel. It is extremely sweet, but the salted part makes sure it doesn't get cloyingly sweet. If you like things a little less sugary, the dark chocolate has the slight bitter flavor of dark chocolate. For dark chocolate fans, like myself, it is a welcome relief. I've also tried a cookie cupcake and it was also exceptional - very sweet like the salted caramel. \n\nSo, although I've enjoyed every cupcake I've gotten, I'm going to have to go back time and time again to the salted caramel. These cupcakes are about half frosting and half cupcake. This is the perfect ratio to me. I'm a huge frosting fan. \n\nThe cupcakes are on the pricier side, but the way I can tell they are worth it to me is I would definitely buy it again. I will be back for my salted caramel cupcake."", ""Have loved sprinkles since I first experienced tasting a cupcake from them in DC (Georgetown location).\n\nThey are insanely good to the point where I won't go anywhere else. First of all, can we talk about the moistness?! I hate places that make it out like their cupcakes are superior, when it turns out it's just a piece of dry ass cake and pounds of buttercream icing on top.\n\nSprinkles is none of that. Their cake is always moist, the cupcakes don't taste like a sugar overload, and the icing is infused with actual flavor and not just cloyingly sweet buttercream. \n\nI'm so excited the Tampa location is open! \nI stalked the website, found out when they had the flavors I wanted, and picked out four cupcakes. I got strawberry, banana, and salted caramel. The strawberry was divine, and I haven't gotten to the banana yet, but what I will say is that I underestimated the salted caramel. I'm usually not too fond of it anymore because that flavor is so over featured now, it's become pretty basic To me. But wow, was I wrong. I'm confident that is by far is the best cupcake they have! So moist, salty and sweet the icing and the sea salt flecks tied everything together in harmony...I'll  even admit that as a strawberry lover!\n\nPlease do yourself a favor and go to sprinkles!! Great location for a place like that!"", ""I'm happy to report that my fur baby Mocha Coconut loved his pupcake. He couldn't stop eating it after his initial lick. It was going going gone. check out the video of him.\n\nI had my lemon blueberry cupcake and it was okay. Yes just okay. It honestly was just quite dry like desert dry not dessert dry. Not that great. The flavor of the lemon was only bc of the frosting. I think it should also be in the cake.  I was excited to try it and may give it another chance bc my pup loved his, but we will just have to see.  I honestly don't think I favored the flavor selection all too much either so ehh.

I\'ve been eyeing the construction of Psomi for quite some time in eager anticipation of its opening as I pass by the area often on my way from Soho to the interstate. It\'s a shame Psomi is only open until 3pm because they\'re closed most of the time I pass by in the evening and it\'s been a tough place to catch open. Psomi elevates the entire North Howard Avenue area with its brand new beautiful building and helps make North Howard no longer just an area you pass by on the way to the interstate. Psomi is located next to another new California style building, Clinical Research of West Florida, and is across the street from a recently renovated Bryan Glazer Family JCC Fitness Center.\n\nOur server told us Psomi literally translates from Greek to ""bread"" but its essence refers to the best bite, the ""choice"" piece, the crumb that everyone at the table fights over. The Decor of the Psomi restaurant is very modern, open, and elegant with large slide out glass panels that extend the open air feel through the back patio and Greek wall art everywhere. However, unlike Acropolis Greek Taverna, off Kennedy, Psomi does not feature any live music, napkin throwing, or belly dancers. \n\nWe came to Psomi for brunch on a Sunday and it was packed with an hour wait for good reason! Psomi is the new hot spot! Psomi\'s parking lot was full and 2 blocks of cars lined both sides of Cass street. Luckily, there was patio seating available for us to wait and we could order coffee or to-go items from Psomi\'s bar. Due to the ability to purchase to-go, our wait for a table ended up being much less than an hour, and only about 25 minutes. I definitely recommend making reservations in advance here! \n\nOur multiple servers that stopped by our table were friendly and knowledgeable but did not seem to communicate between each other as we had to tell 3 people the same thing of what we ordered and that someone already took our order. Once we ordered, food came out in under 10 minutes which was nice. We found it a bit odd that Psomi did not have the most famous best Greek appetizer on its menu, Baha Ganoush, but it turns out they just call it melitzanosalata and it also has eggplant in it. Unfortunately, one of our many servers brought the entree out before the appetizer so we just canceled the appetizer because it missed the whole point of being before the entree.\n\nThe Pork Gyro came with hand stacked pork, tzatziki, tomato, red onions, on a pita with some amazingly spiced fries that were some of the best I\'ve had in a long time! The meal was filling and the pork was lean and not greasy. Aside from all the fries in a container, there were additional fries inside the Gyro too which I\'m not sure is sloppy or meant to be a cool new thing. I\'ll give them the benefit of the doubt,and chock it up to being a cool new thing. The fries were so good, I don\'t mind getting more of them. 10/10 \n\nThe Chicken Souvlaki also came with tzatziki, tomato, red onions, on a pita with some amazingly spiced fries! The marinade on the chicken was very unique and good! 10/10 \n\nFor dessert, we split the baklava coffee cake. It was a pretty big serving enough to adequately split between 3 people, was surprisingly not dry, and not too sweet so I liked it. However, if I do order dressert, I prefer something with chocolate in it. But when in Greece, you gotta try theocal specialities! 7/10 \n\nAlthough service was a bit off and the place is a bit pricier than average, all our food was really good and I really like that this place elevates the entire North Howard area! On my next brunch visit, I look forward to trying the Psomi bagel special with salmon, avocado, cucber, tomato, & cream cheese!', ""I love this place! It's a gem located in an unassuming part of North Howard Ave. I'd say NoHo instead of SoHo but that just doesn't sound right. It's in a neighborhood that is part of North Hyde Park. Who knew? I'd never been to that part of Howard before and it looks like they are constructing new complexes in the area. It's actually starting to look trendy.\n\nAnyway, I'd seen reviews from other Yelp friends and it just looked fantastic. I met up with a friend for my first visit. For your first time, I'd suggest going for breakfast on a week day. It's just not as crowded during that time and it makes it even more comfortable. It's counter service at breakfast. Just place your order and find a seat inside or outside. They bring everything to you once you're seated. The service has been outstanding each time I've been there. I tried the mama's baklava and the fresh fruit filled bougatsa pastry. I loved how the baklava had a clove honey taste. It had a great flavor and it was moist and not dry. The pastry was so light and heavenly. The fruit was perfect and not a single blemish. I was also loving the baklava latte with oat milk. We sat indoors for this visit since it was a very hot day. It was a very delightful visit.\n\nMy second visit was at lunch and the parking lot was full, as well as every seat in the house was occupied. More of a casual business lunch setting at the time. I ended up leaving and going somewhere else. But that didn't keep me from going back for another breakfast this past Thursday. I just had to try the BYO focaccia boat. I'm so glad I did. It's so unique and I loved the feta and mozzarella cheese mixture baked inside the boat. I decided to add an egg and their house cured smoked salmon. It was all delicious. The host noticed right away when bringing it out to me that it didn't have the salmon. He didn't give me a chance to discover that for myself which is great. He apologized and went back to get the smoked salmon. I'm kind of glad that it ended up being served on the side. I got to taste it separately and liked it better that way. The egg was good and you can order it cooked the way you want it. I honestly didn't need the egg. It was so filling that I just couldn't eat it all. It was a large bread boat. I also loved the arugula salad with a touch of dressing and sea salt added. I'd get this again. The double espresso was also a very nice treat. \n\nI didn't leave without getting some baked goods for the road. This time I got the plain bougatsa that is loaded with this amazing and light custard filling. The giant chocolate chip cookie was good but I didn't really taste the chocolate pieces. I could see lots of chips but not a whole lot of chocolate flavor. I'll get a different cookie flavor next time. Other than that, it was a fantastic experience each time. Especially sitting in the front patio in this cool fall weather. It's so pretty out there being surrounded by the beautiful potted bougainvillea. It was a very relaxing morning. Just try it for yourself one day."", 'Psomi is a GORGEOUS new bakery/cafe (""rooted in a Greek foundation"") that just opened in North Hyde Park Tampa today, Nov. 4th. The concept melds Greek and American aspects while including influences from other cultural cuisines as well. ""Psomi"" literally means ""bread"" in the Greek language and this bakery/cafe offers much more than that. Being Greek American myself I appreciate the concept and design of the space.  \n\nThe space was literally stunning! The owner did a complete and extensive rehab/remodel and the old building was completely overhauled. The new space looked like something you might see in Greece quite literally. It is very beautiful and aesthetically pleasing! I cannot wait to dine here but for my first visit today I took some items to go after ordering at the cafe counter. There are baked goods for purchase as well as locally roasted Bandit Coffee (St. Pete). There is also full service available as a dining in option where you can sit in the indoor lit outdoor dining areas. \n\nThe staff I encountered today were incredibly amiable and welcoming. I enjoyed seeing their menu items although today I only had time for drop in service. I have not tried some items I bought but I must tell you the ""spanakopita"" was excellent, fresh and flavorful. I liked how the spinach, cheese, and onion filling was nestled in a croissant vessel of sorts which was lightly sprinkled with sesame seeds. The delicate pastry really complimented the delicious filling. I cannot wait to dig into my tyropita which is a more traditional example of tiropita you would find commonly...a cut square of a mixture of cheeses housed between layers of phyllo dough. \n\nTo some the price point may seem somewhat high however you are paying for great quality ingredients. I am all for paying more when this is the case. Psomi proudly uses local sourced and organic foods ""to their fullest abilities"" and the meats are antibiotic and hormone free. In addition, the breads and baked goods are made fresh daily! Check out the menu and give it a try yourself!\n\nParking is found on the side and in the rear of the building as well as parking on the street.\n\nEnjoy!']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

Having explored the practice of yoga, breathe, meditation, and all the healing attributes that have drawn me to yoga, I experienced nothing of the sort in the class I attended. To say that the owner/instructor used the word FU$& more than 30+ times in her class, is not an understatement. She literally dumped all her bad energy and anger into her practice. Yoga is transforming, peaceful, healing, and a true spiritual practice. I\'m not sure where the lines got blurred to a point that this is even allowed in a class, let alone by the owner. \n\nI even tried to ""work through"" what I was feeling, thinking it was a lesson I could learn from today\'s practice. However, every time I calmed myself and got back into flow, the word A$$, FU$&, and other negative words were yelled out by the instructor. \n\nThis energy is the exact OPPOSITE of everything that yoga is meant to teach someone. I offer healing to the owner, because it\'s obvious she has much more to work through in her own practice and heart, but as a member, this is not the energy that should be dumped on ANYONE, specifically someone going to a yoga class. \n\nThere is a HUGE disconnect to what is being taught in this class as to what a person should experience during their practice. \n\nI never write reviews but this was beyond what should be considered ""yoga."" The instructor could have gotten her message across beautifully in a way through light and love, rather than so much suppressed anger and pain. \n\nPlease work through this before you continue to pass this energy to another member. \n\nWe go to class to heal our bodies. We go to class to clam our minds. We go to class to clear out the noise, not to have the instructor consistently cussing. This is the number one indication of anger and suppressed pain. We are not there  to take an emotional beat down from someone who obviously hasn\'t fully dealt with some major internal scars, and who chooses the bottom of the barrel of communication to get through to her students. \n\nI coach women on wellness and self love, so please take this into consideration, as to how bad this experience was that I had to leave class, write a review, and also spend an hour in nature to release all the negative energy that was just spewed out by the owner.

So good, almost forgot about the long wait that just happened (aka no longer hangry).\n\nWelcome Diner does bang out some great dishes, and next time I will remember things just move a little slow."", ""I'm breaking my rule about reviewing a place after just one visit. After good buzz during Welcome Diner's soft opening I sweet talked my husband and Mark A into waiting outside to be there opening day at 5. I didn't know much about the Phoenix locations, but with three of us eating we got three starters and three entrees last night and finished with dessert. The perk of the experience was meeting Corey, Wayne and Michael who are managers and Michael the head chef; all three answered a barrage of questions from three hard core foodies.\nTo start Corey said the grits was the thing to try; so we ordered Pima Grits, mac n cheese ( with andouline) and boudin chile relleno starter.All three were winners! The egg battered chile relleno came with red tepary beans; which turned out way more delicious that I could have guessed. The rotation between our server and chatting with all the managers made for a cool experience. I ordered a hurricane and later a sazerac and both were wonderful. \nRound one: grits toped with sunny egg, roasted okra n green chili compote topping.\nNext round was our meals which between the three of us was double fried chicken, wood smoked trout and creole jambalaya. Again all three were really very memorable and pure.  The chicken was bone- in and tempura battered with buttery mashed potatoes, and biscuit n neck gravy. I just had a bite of each element but each was rich and hearty as a southern dish should be. The creole jambalaya was my husbands and it isn't made traditionally but grilled on the flat top, so there are crispy bits in the dish which was savory bursts to the dish; came with toast which we didn't eat. Lastly I ordered the trout which is a river trout , wood smoked with garlic and creosote infused; finished with a salsa verde. I loved my dish, which was served with a grilled Indian flat bread which was good but after starters I had no room for. I would absolutely order this again, it was fresh and bright fish without the garlic or lime overpowering the fish. The salsa verde which dressed with dish really complemented the trout.\nRound two: each one of us like our own dish best.\nLastly we were stuffed but did try a dessert of beignets. Basically they were three round doughnuts served with orange blossom honey(?) and powdered sugar; cakey without being greasy. So served like a sopapilla but more a cake doughnut then my preference of a Cafe de Monde airy beignet. There were two other desserts I'll want to try next time; red tepiary tart and their lemon chess pie.\nThe restroom situation; were two stalls in the ladies room and per Mark A two stalls ( no urinal) in the men's room nor a handicap stall. I forgot to check if the ladies restroom had a changing diaper station but I thought the ladies had a larger handicap stall. \nOverall Welcome Diner was awesome; all the starters and entrees were a hit. Can't wait to try their other items. The interior was a bright blue, white and aqua colors with a retro feel, the exterior with fun neon accents. The entire dining experience absolutely made me feel WELCOME in every way.""]",0.5,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,1.0,30.0

I have had a consistently good plate every time. The place is clean and can accommodate large parties, and when they have, it hasn't slowed my food coming to our table. I really love their American Breakfast modified for me to a non-menu listed item called May's Special; white rice, chicken fried protein of choice( I get fish) topped with their fantastic Thai salsa and two eggs cooked to order. For a fun treat they offer a apple walnut banana pancake that comes sliced up on a pizza pan, so you can share easily with the table. It's far more like wonderful coffee cake than a pancake, and if you are wanting a little sweet with your breakfast I highly recommend trying it once. I think you might become hooked. There are two restrooms that are one stall rooms (ladies has no changing table for babies, so i'm guessing the men's would be the same). The place is also very clean and tidy.\n\nI love 4 Seasons.

At this point, I\'m really annoyed at how I\'ve once again found such an oil change place that\'s built upon up-selling and pressuring people. \n\nIt comes to the end of the service and he tells me the total is $45.69. I say, ""woah, what happened to $36.99 or cheaper.""\n\nHe says, ""well after you have Uncle Sam and yadda yadda, you get to the $45.69. And see - only $3 more than the original oil change, plus you get better oil!""\n\nSo here\'s what bothers me:\n\n1) The pressured up-selling to begin with, have I mentioned that?\n\n2) He told me that the price would be equal or less than the base-line oil change.\n\n3) The total came out to $3 more, which he obviously knew beforehand.\n\nDoes paying $3 more for something bother me? Absolutely not. But in principle, this level of sleaziness agitated me to my core. I write a ton of positive reviews for great local businesses that I love, but in this case, I\'m so glad that we have Yelp to get the word out about people and businesses like this. In the past, consumers would have to deal with this kind of stuff without a way to warn others.\n\nSo now that we have this tool, here is my official warning: I would highly recommend looking elsewhere for your oil change, but sadly, I\'ve yet to find a place that I can really vouch for! After my wife had a similar experience at another location, I know one thing for sure - I will never visit a Take 5 again.', ""I was lookin for a place to get oil change and one of my classmates recommended this place. I came here and asked them, I believe one of the guy's names was Kevin and I don't recall the other. They were so nice and welcoming. They were happy to help and not pushy for to me to get service. They checked the oil and recommended to wait to change it. Great shop and will definitely return. They have 25% off any oil change service and other coupons on their website. I highly recommend them and will return here when I need any services"", ""Getting your oil changed does not get any easier than it does at Take 5 Oil Change!\n\nI was pretty bummed when the oil change station near my office closed. This spot was so convenient to go to before work or during my lunch break. Fortunately, I found out that another oil change station, Take 5 Oil Change had purchased the property. After patiently waiting through a month or so of renovations Take 5 finally opened!\n\nI don't even need to leave my car because an oil change takes no more than 15-20 minutes at Take 5 Oil Change! The three guys who serviced my car were so friendly! During my oil change they checked windshield wipers, air filter, tire pressure and the other fluids in my car. They even cleaned my windshield!\n\nMy car takes synthetic oil, which costs a pretty penny, but luckily I keep my mileage low so I only need to get my oil changed once a year. Take 5 Oil Change makes this chore as painless as possible!""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,

Some people call it the Japanese equivalent of dim sum, I call it small plates of bar food.  At I Ai, it is more of a family atmosphere than a bar atmosphere, but the small plates are where its at.  Not as good a those yakatori houses at St. Marks (NYC), but it cures the cravings.\n\nIt was a little difficult to find, located in an office complex called Fountain Oaks off of Waters Ave. near the intersection of Dale Mabry, next to an Albertsons.  We arrived here as soon as they opened, and the was only one other table there, so we were able to get fast service.  The entire dining area could hold probably 40-50 people if maxed out.  Decorations are quaint and the atmosphere is quite comfortable and family oriented.  The menu posted here on Yelp is just their to-go menu, their dine-in menu is way more extensive.  Also, make sure to check the overhead dry-erase boards when you enter for Chef recommendations, specials, and in stock-items that may not be on the menu as well.  We were not charged for free refills on pots of delicious hot green tea.\n\nTheir sushi is decent and to the point. So don\'t come here expecting anything creative or inexpensive because it is exactly the opposite at I Ai in the case of sushi only.  The said that their most popular roll is the Special Mexican Roll ($9.00), so I gave it a try.  It was very solid, with the perfect rice to filling ratio and decent flavor.  However, it wasn\'t nearly as exciting as their kitchen items, and not much different than sushi I could find closer to home for the same quality and price.  \n\nIn my personal opinion, I will not order sushi here again, because their cooked kitchen items are so delicious and inexpensive- it is  like nothing else you will find in the Tampa area.  Don\'t get me wrong, the sushi is solid, but there is so much other food there that I prefer.\n\nIf you are looking for homemade Japanese food, then this is your place.  Nothing is too fancy.  It is great to taste and experience foods that Japanese people would like to enjoy on an everyday basis, not just special occasion.  My husband referred to some items as ""diner food.""  The Okonomiyaki ($8.00) is a Japanese pancake similar to Korean Pajeon.  It is a vegetable pancake that contains pork and covered in a sweet brown sauce and mayo, then a sprinkle of dancing bonito shavings.  The serving is very large, enough for an entire meal with maybe a side of soup or salad.  This pancake only comes in one house flavor, usually shops with specialize in this dish and serve up many custom and specialty flavors, but I Ai just has one for you to try.  It is delicious and crispy, while being creamy, tangy, and smokey at the same time.  \n\nThe Age Tofu ($4.00) is served up my favorite way, where the cubes of fried tofu are floating in dashi broth with shaved radish on top.  So you eat it with a spoon to get a bite of tofu and some delicious broth at the same time.   The Sunomono ($4.00) was bright and refreshing with cucumber, crab stick, and a sweet shrimp on top- all covered in a sour citrus dressing.  I always have to order the Omusubi (Onigiri) if it is offered, especially when they are only $2.00 each for your choice of mouth-watering bonito, plum, or salmon fillings.  They are the side of a small hamburger and just as filling, so watch out.  The Soy Sauce Ramen ($7.00) was a large serving and the noodles were perfectly chewy with flavorful broth.  \n\nI was a little confused from the other photos posted here of small vegetable side dishes, which made me assume that I Ai served up complimentary side dishes with an entrée.   That is not the case.  Most of the side dishes (similar to Korean banchan, but not complimentary) range from $2.00-$4.00 per serving.  We tried the Yama Sengiui ($4.00) which was julienne strips of slimy mountain potato-like root.  Sally recommends trying it graded with tuna for the same price next time, and we will.\n\nThe Shabu-Shabu is what I came for.  While they had many stone pot soups- the cook at your table experience of Shabu-Shabu was $28.00, and I just was not ready to pay that much per person yet on my first try.\n\nI can definitely see I Ai having many regulars because of their cheap menu, delicious food, cute atmosphere, and fast service.  We will definitely return to try more items, since we probably just scratched the surface here today.  As I said before; it is impossible to find everyday Japanese food like this in the Tampa area.  Maybe in New York City, but not here, so I feel very lucky to have found I Ai.  I was very impressed when dining here, and also had a fun time.  Compared to other establishments in Tampa- 5 stars.\n\nTons of food $44.41 before tip', ""For all the sushi that I eat, I have never really had too much regular Japanese cuisine dishes except for instant ramen and the occasional Teriyaki Chicken, so coming to I Ai Sushi was a new experience for me. I decided to go with my friend Sally's Yelp review and try her recommended dishes. Here is how they fared up for me:\n\n-Kaki fry (fried oysters): Just as good as Sally described them, I almost did not get a picture of it because they were so good we ate the four oysters right away. A new favorite dish for me. I have had oysters cold but never fried before and I was really impressed with how it tasted. Certainly worth the $4.50 I paid for it too. It's a special so hopefully they will have it there if you guys pay a visit.\n\n-Katsu-curry (curry with breaded fried pork cutlet): Delicious. A new taste for me since I have never had Japanese curry before. Not spicy in a hot kinda way but spiced with a strong flavor. The rice was cooked well too, it was filling too I had to share with my friends.\n\nI tried their soy sauce ramen noodles off a friend and it was good, I'm not a big noodle either though so I can't say too much about it. The tuna sashimi in their Tuna Yamakake was great and really fresh, the grated yama-imo was a taste I have never had before kinda slimy but not in a bad way...hard to describe haha I say just try it for yourself and see if you like it.\n\nWanting something lite to top it off I ordered some mochi ice cream which is $1.50 a piece, not a bad add-on to finish you off since it is not too heavy. The only flavor they had was green tea which was great and a nice way to end my visit at I Ai Sushi. \n\nThe bill was pretty cheap considering the food I got and I got to try so many new things, I'll be coming back here to check out their entrees in the future. Service was quick and though the waitress could have been a little friendlier, I will let it slide this time since service was quick and the food was excellent. \n\nThe restaurant itself is nicely decorated, plate have designs on them, some seats have heart shaped cushions and even what looked stuffed animal pillows, and there was fish tank there as well. The girls complimented the female bathroom (though I can't share my thoughts on that).\n\nOn my way out of the restaurant I noticed they had all these Japanese drinks for sale there too and I was sad that I only ordered a water to drink when I could have had Ramune or some other Japanese drink but now I know for future visits =)\n\nCheck it out =)"", 'I Ai Sushi.... I don`t know where to start, there is just so many words to describe this place honestly. \n\nI met up with my friend  to have lunch. Okay so I must admit I was kind of skeptical about this place, its in a run down shopping strip and not enough traffic flowing through but boy was I surprised by the food. Amazing!! The sashimi tasted fresh which is important and my bento box was huge. The server was this sweet girl, like she was truly a gem. I have never been to a place where they give you eel sauce and spicy mayo I was like whoa what I always have to have for extra. \n\nOkay so this is not your typical traditional sushi Japanese eating place, there`s a twist to the food and it brings traditional Japanese food to a twist. The place itself is very small and a tad over crowded with stuff but the food and service was excellent so you kind of look past stuff like that. I haven`t been for supper but I will definitely go back for lunch.']",0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,1.0,30.0

It has good beer hall, stage, decoration, art and ambient. Please check their calendar for event and special. I encourage them to continue to do it to attract the customers. \n\nI got their watermelon mint wheat ale. It was interesting to have because of the watermelon flavor. Price is in the median. The stage has good three D decoration with the eyes look at you no matter where you seat. It has projected the fish aquarium on the wall. The art gallery is another way for me to stroll. \n\nWe were here for the Asian food truck rally. There people at the bar serving are nice to customers.', ""Went here during the soft opening after following them on Facebook for quite some time. I honestly didn't realize that they weren't fully 'open' yet but decided to stop by on this past Sunday evening. The location is really weird...in a strip mall that is being completely remodeled (there's a Youfit next door and a massive non denominational church being constructed...which I think was a Winn-Dixie at one time). Parking is obviously easy because the lot is massive and there aren't many businesses in this mall. The brewery itself is very dark and simple. The brewing takes place in the back and is open to see. The bar is a pretty decent size with plenty of stools and there are many wooden tables scattered around. It has a factory feel to it with very high ceilings and concrete floors. \n\nThe wall murals were the most impressive part of this brewery. You are supposed to feel like you are inside of a shark's mouth and there is a big white square that will be used to project movies in the future. I like the dark lighting and the way the bar is lit up. They have usb plugs in abundance but no purse hooks yet. The bathrooms are still under construction but the sinks are located outside of the bathrooms and are set up like kegs. Super cool! Plus it keeps traffic moving out of the bathrooms and you can tell who doesn't wash their hands! Stay sanitary people.\n\nAs for the beers, they only have a core list of 6 beers right now. The best in my opinion is the Ramble On Raspberry Ale. All beers are low ABV and the IPA needs some work in my opinion. The beertenders were super cool and they offered me a mix of the raspberry and stout which was tasty. Beers are $5/$6. I'm excited to see what they offer in the future since i was told that they will have guest taps down the road. \n\nThere was a food truck outside and i imagine they will have a rotating food truck gathering after their official opening. I also expect a larger selection of beers once they get going. I totally support this brewery, because it is the first in the immediate area and they have a large space to expand.

Its 81Bay. \nI sampled a few of their beers\nBut they were all just okay. \n\nThe space they have is massive. \nThough, to me, it felt rather empty. \nBut they've got these cool glass beer taps\nWhere the colorful beers did tempt me. \n\nTwo of the beers that I tried\nWere the Raspberry ale and their stout. \nWhile they both had decent flavor,\nThey were nothing to write home about. \n\nThere was this really creepy mural. \nThey project movies up on another wall\nWhile I was there, they played Major League \nThey followed that with Spaceballs. \n\nI appreciate what they have to offer \nTo the Tampa Bay craft beer scene. \nBut I have many others I need to try\nBefore I come back, if you know what I mean.""]",0.75,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.0,1.0,15.0

OjHQumZ6nCh5vqzUbmkaNg,Das Alpenhaus Delikatessen,Boise,ID,43.592002,-116.213099,4.5,71,"Restaurants, German, Grocery, International Grocery, Food, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Beer Bar, Ethnic Grocery, Bars, Nightlife, Delis","['restaurants', 'german', 'grocery', 'international grocery', 'food', 'beer', 'wine & spirits', 'beer bar', 'ethnic grocery', 'bars', 'nightlife', 'delis']",2.0,"['""I put my heart into this"", said the owner to my husband and me at the end of our first visit to Das Alpenhaus when we went in to eat at the deli and shop the little market.  We could already tell that was so from the sparkling interior and delicious food made from top quality ingredients.  This won\'t be an often visited destination for us given the limited amount of seating and the distance from our home but it is definitely on our \'eager to return list\' each time.  Planning ahead for your visit might help given only one hot dish is prepared daily and when it is gone it is gone.  No worries on that score though, because the soups, deli sandwiches and salads are delicious too.  So, here is what you might want to know before you go.\n\nTHE LAYOUT:  Sparkling and welcoming from the moment you walk in the door.   Seating for maybe six each at two picnic style tables.  There are well organized and stocked shelves of German and other Euro specialty items.  We were last in in November, and there were all kinds of traditional German holiday treats on the shelves.  Plus a great selection of luscious D\'Arbo preserves - great for gifts or yourself are these luscious products from 5th generation family owned Austrian business!   Also a small section of beer and wine in an alcove - we bought a nice bottle of Alsatian Pinot Blanc.\n\nTHE DRILL:  When I was a little kid my favorite book (Mr. Angelo\'s Kitchen) was about a chef who cooked only one thing a day and then sold it until it sold out.  I was first intrigued to go into Das Alpenhaus by reading a review that said this chef did that very same thing.  \n\nThere is one hot deli dish made each day and served \'til sold out.  The menu for the week is posted on Das Alpenhaus\' Facebook page if you want to plan ahead for your visit.  The weekly menu for those specials also appears on a menu board above the counter.  Given the number of local folks with German or Eastern European heritage who have already discovered this for authentic German cooking, the specialty hot dish is often gone before the end of the lunch hour.  And, no, you cannot call in advance orders for take out.  I asked.\n\nTHE FOOD:  Ingredients are top notch and so is preparation, based on our experience.  The owner brings in real German style sausage made by company in Seattle.  Also real German Style breads, like great German rye, from a German bakery in Salt Lake.  The ham and Swiss we had on rye bread with warm sauerkraut added and grainy mustard was among the best of all deli sandwiches we\'ve had in Boise.  Soups are delicious too,  We highly recommend the red potato salad in the deli case.  Everything is made in house.\n\nIf I could wave a magic wand I\'d have them sell hot German potato salad daily and also the braised red cabbage.  But those are only available as part of the hot dish specials on days when they are part of that offering. \n\nAs heads up, this is a wonderful place for omnivores but vegetarians may find options more limited.\n\nTHIS N THAT:\n\n1) PARKING:  Small private lot.\n\n2) ACCESSIBILITY:  Minimal accessible parking but there is at least one spot.  Entry is ramped from the parking lot be level in at door and all one one level.  Ample aisle space.  Seating at picnic table ends may work for wheelchair users; I didn\'t check that.  Bathroom accessible.  Looks as if these accessibility elements were newly added as tenant improvements by the owners.  \n\n3) NICE TOUCH:  German language / music station playing at just the right level not to compete with conversation but to know it is there adds to the sense of authenticity.  It made us homesick, in the best way, for the home of our German friends who hosted us at so many wonderful meals and spoke German at their table.', ""Das Alpenhaus isn't just a German deli. It's a whole experience that everyone should experience. You've gotta love the adorable grocery store that has tons of European goodies and novelties. It's hard not to grab something while waiting for your food.\n\nI'll keep this short and sweet because I could go on and on. My absolute favorite item on the menu is the Schnitzel Sandwich (thinly pressed pork cutlet, egg washed, breaded and then fried served on a pretzel bun with mustard, mayonnaise, and fresh cucumbers, onions, tomato and lettuce. $11.99). Holy schmoley this sandwich is huge but you'll want it all to yourself. The schnitzel is about twice as big as the pretzel bun. I was already feeling full even before digging into the pretzel bun. Every bite is heavenly!!! Perfectly breaded and fried. \n\nMy other faves are the Reuben Sandwich and Bratwurst on a Brötchen, but I'm convinced you can't go wrong with whatever you get at Das Alpenhaus. Highly recommend!"", ""I had meant to check out Das Alpenhaus after hearing good comments about them after they opened last fall, but I just don't get out Vista way very often around lunchtime. Today, I thought of them and stopped in.\n\nI knew from reading about them they prepare one hot dish daily along with their selection of sandwiches and soups. I went to their Facebook page to look up their choice for the week and saw they were offering Hackbraten and Salzkartoffeln, a beef and pork meatloaf with fried potatoes and a mushroom gravy.\n\nThe waitress standing behind the deli counter was friendly and asked if I had been there before. She explained their lunch offerings and I told her I had come for the hot dish. She prepared me a plate from the dishes held in a hot case, which meant I was seated and ready to begin eating in just a couple of minutes.\n\nThe hot dish of the day has a limited number of servings, so once it's gone it's gone. You have to come back another day if you show up too late. But their sandwiches and soups are always available. \n\nThe meatloaf was tender and flavorful. The gravy, complete with sliced mushrooms was very good and there was enough to douse the potatoes in it, as well.\n\nThe shop also includes a grocery filled with German and other European foods and a wide variety of beers. A freezer contains a selection of sausages.\n\nI read some early reviews that mentioned that seating was limited, with two wooden tables that could hold six diners each. Since then, they pulled the wooden tables away from the front windows and added several two-seat tables. There are additional tables outside.\n\nThe hardest part about dining at Das Alpenhaus is finding the right shop. Their road sign is easy to spot driving from either direction on Vista Avenue. But there's no sign on the building itself. \n\nThe parking lot of the small strip mall the restaurant is located in is split by a curblike concrete divider. Das Alpenhaus is located on the north side of the curb and the closest to that curb. Look for the cold case inside.\n\nI was very pleased with my meal and the service. Everyone was friendly. It's nice to have a choice of eating at another family-owned ethnic restaurant in Boise.""]",0.6,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.0,1.0,30.0

Friendly staff, clean and comfortable rooms and convenient location.\n\nThere were a few ""hiccups"" too and enough to mention them here to help set expectations. Somehow surprises don\'t seem as unhappy if you\'re prepared to think they could happen.   (The problems seem to be in process and procedure not in customer service training.  Process problems are easier to correct.)   In the meantime, by far the best mid range lodging experience of our visits to Boise.\n\nThe PROS:\n\n1) STAFF:  Friendly and efficient at check in and check out.  Our reservations were all in order and we got the room type and location we requested.  Every staff member we met during our stay was engaged and courteous.  Very nice.\n\n2) PUBLIC SPACES & EATS:  Large breakfast / evening room where breakfast is served 7 days a week and an evening ""light meal"" Mon - Thurs.  We never eat evening meals at a Homewood, but the breakfast comes in handy as they always have something that even we  who eat low on the food chain and eschew processed foods can enjoy.  If you\'re into the standard American hot breakfast as offered at hotel chains, you\'ll probably find this is one of the best offered. And the staff keeping all in order are so friendly and efficient.  \n\n3) ROOMS:  Two room types here.  The ""all in one room"" and the ""separate bedroom suite"".  We prefer the latter.  Well laid out with spacious closet  near bathroom sink, spacious WC and shower room, living room includes desk and comfy desk chair, kitchen with full fridge, etc. Works well for an extended stay or a short one.\n\n4) CLEAN:  Everything sparkled everywhere.  From public spaces to halls to rooms.\n\n5) ELECTRONICS:  Free, fast, reliable WIFI.  Large screen, good quality TV in living and bedroom. \n\n6) EXERCISE: Finishing touches were just being made to the updated exercise room during our stay.  Three treadmills, weights, gliders, bicycles, etc. All in good working order and the room was bright with windows on both sides and with good AC.\n\n7) LOCATION:  Easy on and off the freeway to get to either downtown Boise or Eagle.  \n\nThe CONS:\n\n1) MAINTENANCE REQUEST RESPONSE: We had a couple of maintenance issues we noted on arrival in our room, minor but needing attention like burned out light in the kitchen.  It took two calls across two days to get it fixed.  On the second day no one answered the service phone after multiple attempts so we had to go to the lobby to re-report the issue. \n\n2) HOUSEKEEPING:  We recognize the tough job housekeepers have and try to be very tidy guests in return.  We also appreciate how clean were the rooms. But each day there was some ""surprise"".  As in fresh towels left but old ones not taken. As in finding all lights in every room and the ceiling fan in the bedroom on when we returned one night.  As in finding a cleaning bucket with supplies smack dab in the middle of the hallway when returning another night.  Likely could be solved by a supervisor walk through for reinforcing details for the young guys (at least on our floor) doing the cleaning.   They\'re working hard and I\'m sure they\'d apply the reinforcement of the basics.  \n\n3) LOCK OUT SNAFU: On our third day we were locked out of the entry door on the wing of our building. In the rain.  And had to go to the lobby to have our keys reactivated.  On the fourth day the keys were difficult to get to work in the exterior door.  We talked to other guests with the same problem.  In the context of the world\'s suffering, think people living in Ukraine, we know this is less than small thing.  But hopefully it is a think they will fix. \n\nTHIS N THAT:\n\n1) ACCESSIBILITY:  All public spaces seem nicely accessible.  \n\n2) ROOM TIPS:  The back of the building, the south side, is quietest and rooms there look out onto an open parcel.  Parking is also most convenient there.  As in all hotels, I\'d say avoid the first floor rooms if you can.  A heads up that  the hotel is in the flight pattern for Boise\'s Airport and that seems most noticeable on the south side of the building.  \n\n3) NEIGHBORS:  A few restaurants are nearby (like a BBQ place and a chain Italian) if that\'s your thing.  Costco is a couple of blocks away and a movie theater too.', ""Absolutely the best place for a family to stay. Very clean, modern, and my children love the breakfasts and dinners.

I said CAN YOU PLEASE train later I need a key why are you ignoring me? he didn't budge kept his head down. I  said can we trainer later?  He , kept his  head down , continues training and she was going very slow. I said please  make me a key now and train her later I need to  go!!!?\n\nFinally he asked her to step aside and I, at last, got my key. I dont blame her but, at last, its  COVID1 time maybe 30 people in hotel and you have a guest in front if you in a hurry. It now angered me to be ignored. He apologized only after I  said I am going to write a review,  you earned it buddy.\n\nHonestly, if a gueat tells you three times they are in a hurry, why not stop training and get a key made?\n\nCould you not train and  practice without a guest waiting? How do you think she felt under pressure? What a poor decison to do with a Diamond frequent stay guest!!!\n\nI would have rated five stars if it was not for that  idiot manager.

I ordered their pad thai with fried tofu and my mom had a noodle dish with a ginger basil sauce that she raved about.

My mom ordered and enjoyed a glass of their chardonnay.

Even when packed with people the wait time from seating to order and from order to service is efficient.  \n\nMENU & FOOD:  Extensive menu of Thai dishes including house specials.  They offer lunch menu from 11a to 3p with combination plates that run from about $8 - $8.50 and so prime time lunch hours seem particularly busy.\n\nWe always order off the main menu - combination plate diners R not US - which offers a host of choices from appetizers through soups, noodles, fried rices, curries and entree dishes. You can\'t miss with any of the Thai curries here, like red, green Panang, or Mussamman.   If you\'re a ginger fan try the Caramelized Ginger entree.   If I could wave a magic wand, I\'d have them add Khao Soi to the menu. \n\nWe order \'medium\' on their heat scale and it works for my hubby and me if we\'re sharing dishes, although he\'d go up a notch if left on his own.  The kitchen is very consistent in heat level so once you find the one you like it\'s a ""go"" each time.\n\nPortions are generous if ordering from the main menu.

When I did I was interested and filed it in the back of my mind to possibly stop in. I'm certainly glad I did. The inside is very unassuming but it works well. You'll find a very extensive menu board posted overhead and a clean dining area. I quickly found what I wanted and ordered to go.\n\nI ordered two bean burritos without cheese. I'll put my disclaimer here if anyone is mostly plant based like I am, I don't know if the re fried beans contain lard. I didn't ask. Some places use lard in their re fried beans and if I would have thought of it at the time I would have asked. Anyway, my to go order came out very fast (less then 5 minutes) in the mean time I visited the salsa bar and got a few tasty looking salsas. I wish they were labeled but it's not a big deal. The burritos were huge! Truly large portions are served here. \n\nWhen I got back to my hotel I ate the burritos and they were very, very good. I was surprised at the flavors of such a simple dish but the tortilla was outstanding and the beans were on point. I added salsas to them and it just made the flavors more intense. I really enjoyed my meal and it was very reasonably priced. \n\nThe service was very warm and kind. I will most definitely be back if I am in the area again."", ""If you're not a stranger to Tucson, you're no stranger to Nicos, LosBetos, Viva, etc.  This is yet another place to get great mexican food that doesn't cost much, and puts portion size higher on the priority list than interior decorations- and that's just fine with me!  This locations facilitates dining in a little better than some others solely due to the interior room available, the seating is still bare like a McDonald's.  But the food is delicious and more than makes up for perceived short-comings inside.  More than just a burrito stand, you can order combination plates, enchiladas, tacos, rolled tacos, quesadillas, tostadas...

But after many, many visits, I\'ve come to grips with saying that Java is just A-Ok. \n\nFirstly, Java is a nice addition to the charming Hyde Park area. It is truly a neighborhood coffee shop as many people can walk or ride their bikes there. Unfortunately, there are lots of other people (like me) who don\'t live in the North End and drive there. This makes Java crowded, noisy and hard to find parking. They have two single bathrooms tucked very close to tables in the back, and it can be difficult to navigate the maze to get back there (especially with a preschooler doing the potty dance). Though there is a ramp in back, I doubt this place is easy for folks with walkers, wheel chairs or strollers to navigate. The tables are very close together and the doors are not very wide. \n\nI do not like their coffee. It often tastes bitter and burnt to me, especially the iced coffee. They do have a nice ""additions"" bar where you can add all sorts of things like liquid cane sugar, soy milk, cinnamon, etc. \n\nFor me, the pastries are hit or miss. The muffins are amazing, the scones are super dry and small. I had a maple bacon donut once and it was ok. My husband does like their breakfast burritos. \n\nThey do have quite a lot of patio seating so it\'s not quite as crowded in the summer. I totally understand why lots of people love Java. But it\'s not my ideal coffee spot.', 'Nestled in the heart of Hyde Park, this coffee house is an absolute gem!  Located in a darling little (what seems to me, 1920\'s maybe?) house, Java not only serves a fabulous cup of joe but offers a charming atmosphere (including in AND outside seating).  Frequented by many in the historic North End neighborhood--this place is bustling with energy, as on any given weekday morning you will find North Enders casually gathered for a little neighborhood gossip over coffee (while I was there, the people sitting next to me were discussing some construction being done in the neighborhood and before I knew it, three other tables and a guy in line were all in on the discussion).  \n\nOk...ok...let\'s get down to business...because, though the décor may be darling, the service fast and friendly, the patrons amusing, and the location incredible--that doesn\'t mean a lick to this caffeine junkie if the coffee isn\'t stellar!  Which, thankfully it is!  Their coffee is certified organic and absolutely marvelous.  I generally order their skinny caramel mocha, which never fails to delight.  They offer an array of baked goodies, all made from scratch with organic ingredients whenever possible.  They also have a limited menu of café style breakfast and lunch items.  I didn\'t indulge in the baked goodies the morning I went, but I did have an egg croissant, which was decent (their eggs are ""steamed"", which I\'m not sure of...they have a bit of a strange texture to me).  The person I was with, however, ordered their eggs Benedict and was wowed.\n\nOther notes:  Their prices are a bit higher than other places in town (I paid over $4 for my mocha), but it was far better than many other places in town.  Their breakfast items WERE a bit overpriced in my opinion.   Oh, and a quick note with regards to their mochas:  They use a Mexican chocolate for their mochas, which I absolutely enjoy but tastes very different than your standard American, or even any of your European chocolates.  You CAN opt for a more traditional chocolate, you just have to ask.', ""Gotta go with 5 stars on this one.... their food is bomb, their coffee is bomb, their location is bomb, their friendly staff are, you guessed it, bomb!  Java - Hyde Park simply does things right, from their Bowl of Soul mocha to their Tuna melt sandwich.  Add to that their amazing Hyde Park location, their seating options (indoor, deck, patio), and the equally friendly staff and patrons... and you have a recipe for a stellar coffee house.  \n\nIf you haven't yet been, try them out.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0

All orders were placed at the bar and the beers were poured & served to us immediately. I was really surprised to see that they had 20+ beer choices on tap AND also a few wine choices on tap.\n\nI'm actually not much of a beer drinker, so I thought I would try out some of the fruitier beers. I went with a flight of the Death by Coconut, Belgian Peach, Passionfruit Pinner, and Imperial Raspberry Stout. As expected, I liked the Belgian Peach and Passionfruit Pinner the best since the Death by Coconut and Imperial Raspberry Stout were both dark beers. While the coconut, peach, and passionfruit flavor came through in the beers, the raspberry one was the only one that did not have as much of the flavor as expected. I actually liked the Passionfruit Pinner so much, I went back up to get a 16oz glass of it (which is unusual for me).\n\nMy fiancé ended up going with a flight as well with the Campfire Stout, Tank 7, Victory @ Sea, and Black Butte XXVIII. Three of the beers were really dark (Tank 7 was not), but the favorite of this flight was definitely the Campfire Stout. You could literally taste a marshmallow flavor in the beer, like a s'more. His brother ended up going back to get that a full glass of that one and commented that he liked it much more than the Death by Coconut which he had gotten first. Fiancé's brother's wife got two different kinds of red wine and commented that the AZ wine (did not catch the name) was the better of the two.\n\nPricing was fair (I believe). The four 5oz pours for the flight were $9, and the 16oz was $5.50. I'm not sure how this compares to other breweries, however I will say that the beers were very strong! We went early afternoon on a Saturday so it wasn't too busy. We were able to grab a parking spot right out front and an empty table inside as well.

They were super friendly however I felt they could get to know a bit more about beer and the beer that they're serving especially. I felt I knew more about them....

An important thing to note is that there is only one seat (a barstool) inside the cafe.  Ceres is essentially a take-out only place.  However, you can sit in the little picnic area by the stained glass outside of La Cocina to enjoy your pasta lunch.  \n\nFresh pasta is only served 11am until sold out.  You can order the type of fresh pasta you want to eat with one of their sauces, or you can take the uncooked fresh pasta to go to cook yourself at home.  Bucatini (like spaghetti with a hole in the middle of the noodle) is the vegan option, while the tagliatelle (wide and flat) and tagliolini (thin and flat) are egg noodles.  \n\nWe arrived around 11:30, and the cafe filled up quickly.  Mr. Picky Toddler Who Doesn't Like Sauce On Anything chose plain (no EVOO or butter or anything) bucatini, while my foodie bestie and I decided to split the special (tagliatelle with beet, arugula, cheese, and some other ingredients - lemon, maybe?) and tagliolini with the cacio e pepe sauce.  We also decided to try the mocha drink (made with Monsoon Chocolate) and the matcha latte.  \n\nAll of the pastas were cooked perfectly al dente and were delicious, including the plain bucatini.  Even the toddler tried and repeatedly requested more of both the special and cacio e pepe pasta (eating pasta with sauce instead of plain for the first time ever!)  Everyone's favorite pasta was the tagliolini with cacio e pepe - simple, but with great flavor.  The mocha drink was subtly sweetened by the dark Monsoon chocolate, and it was a joy to drink.  The matcha latte had no added sweetener, but it had good matcha flavor and was smooth and creamy.  We polished off all of the pasta and drinks happily while enjoying the beautiful fall weather at the picnic tables.  Given how tasty everything was, we made a pledge to come back and try all of the different pasta sauces over the next few weeks.  \n\nTL;DR: Delicious fresh pasta (only for lunch 11a until sold out) and cafe drinks; little hole in the wall across street from La Cocina; no indoor seating (basically take out only; some outdoor picnic tables by La Cocina).  Recommend: cacio e pepe on any pasta, mocha, matcha latte"", ""I went yesterday with a couple of co-workers for lunch.  We agreed that it was one of the best places we've been in a while.  It was the last chance to go eat anywhere before restaurants were shut down due to the corona virus, so we were lucky enough to enjoy the outdoor eating area located near La Cocina.  I got the tagliatelle with cacio + pepe for lunch, it was creamy and divine with a cheesy, peppery goodness, and came with a small piece of focaccia bread, I loved the little to-go container that it came in.  I got some bucatini and bolognese to take home for dinner as well.  Fresh daily made pasta, sauce, there is also coffee, and pastries!

The beer mustard on the table was the perfect complement. The chef came by to say hello - shoutout to the Midwest - and every staff member we encountered was friendly and attentive.

I'd order this again for sure. \n\nWe had a group get together to celebrate Bourdain Day and the Bourdain Special was probably one of the best soups I've tried. Portuguese sausage and kale soup with Barrio Bread. The presentation was beautiful too. Bourdain would have been proud. Hopefully we'll see this dish on the special rotation again!

We settled on Peking duck as the solution to our cravings, and I set about finding a location that might actually serve it.  Enter Peking Palace, the only place that Yelp yielded as a source for the dish.\n\nWe decided to share half a Peking duck, a ""lunch special"" order of Northern-style vegetables (to keep things healthy, you see -- the egg roll and fried rice were merely tolerated and not actively sought out or gobbled voraciously), and a pot of Oolong tea.  While we waited, we were treated to crispy noodles with a very mild sweet and sour sauce.  The staff was extremely attentive about keeping our water glasses full, and both of the ladies who helped us were very friendly.\n\nThe lunch special was quite good as far as standard Chinese restaurant lunch specials go -- the helping was generous, the vegetables were properly-cooked, and the dish tasted about how I would have hoped given what it was.  The Peking duck was served de-boned; the skin had also been removed and apparently fried to achieve the desired crispy texture.  As expected, the duck was accompanied by a few pieces of green onion that had been flowered out at both ends, some hoisin sauce, and some thin pancakes.  The end result was quite tasty, as duck, fried duck skin, green onion, and hoisin sauce in a pancake almost cannot help but being delicious.  \n\nFor those who have had more faithful recreations of Peking duck, it may be difficult to get beyond the clearly non-traditional preparation methods used here.  A real Peking duck is prepared using a time consuming process of hanging the duck in a seasoned marinade for a number of hours, and then achieving the desired crispiness of the skin when the duck is roasted.  This Peking duck was clearly not the result of such a process.  For $12 for half a bird, I can\'t say I blame them, but if you\'re hoping to have an authentic Peking duck experience you should probably not expect to get that at Peking Palace.\n\nIf you show up expecting a solid Chinese food restaurant in the standard vein, then our experience suggests that you won\'t be disappointed.  We found good service, tasty food, and decent prices here.  Just don\'t show up expecting anything more than a cheap imitation of any iconic imperial Chinese dishes you may happen to order.', 'I have a love-hate relationship with Chinese food.  When I am in China (though the last time I was there was two years ago), I crave Panda Express.  When I am eating Panda Express in the U.S, I crave something more authentic.  Is there a compromise - really good Americanized food, perhaps?\n\nSee, when I have had ""traditional, authentic"" Chinese food, it has been mostly the preferred dark meat (a specialty!), mostly the other half of the animal I don\'t eat (tendons, knuckles, wings, etc), covered in oil, and mostly squishy textures.\n\nBut Peking Palace really brought me back to China, something I can\'t say for most Chinese places.  And what better day to go than the beginning of the Lunar New Year!\n\nWhen I first walked in and sat in a red-fabric booth surrounded by Chinese paintings, I noticed that there were tables of Mandarin-speaking elderly eating.  When I want to hear Spanish, I go to Little Cafe Poca Cosa.  When I want to hear Mandarin now, I will definitely come to Peking Palace.\n\nThey do have a lunch buffet, but it is not that impressive, and it\'s mostly like a hybrid of Americanized and traditional.  For example, there were sauteed bean sprouts, some fried whole chopped up chicken, some lo mein, and some egg drop soup that I saw.  Most people eating there today actually ordered off the menu.\n\nI asked my Chinese friends if they had heard of Peking Palace, and appropriate to the name, they said that it was one of the few places that serves \'Peking\' Duck.\n\nI was immediately impressed by the hot tea served.  You don\'t have to ask for it and wonder if it\'s free or not.  The tea is black and delicious - no strong hints of jasmine or chrysanthemum.  I never eat those won ton chips that come with the meals, but these were pretty good - light and crispy.\n\nI ordered the dumplings that they called ""ravioli.""  You can get them either steamed or fried.  I ordered them fried, and my friend actually started drinking the dipping sauce!  It was good.  It was like a high-quality soy sauce with chili oil on the rim and green onions in it.  The dumplings were as authentic as the street food in China; slightly doughy, larger than the ones you usually get at restaurants, and yummy!  Six were $6.50 I think.\n\nI can read Chinese, and the servers could speak Mandarin and Cantonese.  I read somewhere in the restaurant that the owners are from Taiwan and the food is specialized in Sichuan/Szechuan and Northern cuisine.  \n\nThere is a Chinese menu which is a piece of paper with simplified Mandarin Chinese characters but no translation or prices.  Things like steamed sea bass, salt and pepper chicken, sauteed beef, and the like.  I can tell you more if you want.\n\nI ordered Szechuan Beef and Spicy Tofu.  The Szechuan Beef was picture perfect, but the only bad thing was that it was 80% celery which totally overpowered the dish.  My friend was surprised that it was neither sweet or salty or garlicky, so it was surprising to her.  I was very surprised because I asked for extra spicy, and it was extra mild.\n\nThe Spicy Tofu was not spicy either.  Honestly, the whole dish appeared to be canned but was much better when I ate it!  I asked for it extra spicy and it was mild.  It was great how it had tiny slivers of cooked dried pork instead of just ground meat.  It was a different interpretation because it was silken tofu!  Extra slimy instead of the firm tofu I was expecting.  I liked it, but it was so different of a congealed texture.\n\nI was drooling over the food on the next table over.  They ordered chow mein and it had tons of veggies on it.  It looked so delicious.  They also ordered soup, and the soups looked amazing.  At this point,  felt like I was in China or at least the best Chinatowns and was so in that mood, so I was surprised when other non-Chinese started walking into the restaurant.  Yeah, I was displaced for a second.\n\nAll that food was $20 which I thought was pretty good considering I had jiaozi pot stickers, two large platters of food for two people and more for leftovers, and tea.  Although I was not in a hurry, it took 25 minutes for our food to come out which is a little bit longer than most places I believe.\n\nOverall, great experience, just different food for me.  I want to go back and get some of their noodles and soups!  Their rating will probably either go up or down, if you know how repeat visits usually affect ratings...  I better get spicy next time!', ""Best Chinese food in a town that isn't known for it's wonderful Chinese food. Szechuan  chicken, extra hot, is a personal favorite.

Hell Yes. Biscuits and Gravy the size of your head? Word. Coffee with a peculiar viscosity? Well...it IS Idaho.\n\nThey advertise ""World Famous Scones"". You will not be disappointed. I actually skipped the Scones for the first few times I was here, because scones, to me, were those dry blob looking pastries that you got at coffeehouses. At Merritts, a scone is essentially a warm, soft, sheet of fried dough the size of a plate. Throw some butter and honey on that sucker, and you\'ve successfully defeated a hangover.\n\nOh, and the whole thing will run you like 5 bucks.\n\nLike I said, the place is a ramshackle roadhouse a few miles out of town, the restrooms are fantastically filthy, the place is full of drunks, young and old. The walls are covered in greasy pictures of racehorses, and the impossibly old jukebox plays Cash, Haggard, Jones, and Jennings. I cant remember, but I think it might actually play 45\'s.\n\nIf Merritt\'s were a person, you would be all \'Merritt\'s is good people\'.', ""Two words ........... Be afraid !!!!! ..............This place sucks. When my wife and I went in it was by far the epitome of a dive or hole in the wall. (not in a good way) It was busy so we overlooked the shabbiness of the place because we figured if that many people went there the food must be good. BIG mistake on our part. We were sat right in the path of everybodys way. Customers going to the  restroom, servers delivering food, customers coming into the place. Just in the way. It also took forever to get our drinks. Even longer to have a server get our order. Only one cook. Looks like she just got out of prison and so skinny it was obvious she didn't even eat there. We finally moved to a booth which was much better.\n\nA family of 5 came in, mom, dad, and 3 girls at the table we were first sat down at. Only 4 chairs, and the servers didn't even try to get a 5th chair. They finally left because of the lack of attention they got. Finally we got our order placed and the server recommended the chicken fried steak. It took 30 minutes to get our order. Remember..... only one cook. My wife ordered an omelet. Got our food finally. Chicken fried steak so greasy it made my stomach upset withing 15 minutes of trying to eat it. Gravy sucked, eggs over done, toast cold. My wife's meal was not much better. \n\nSo since this placed brags about their scones, we ordered one...... Waited another 20 minutes and never got it. Refills on drinks was a joke. I had to ask every time to get refills. Long story over with ..... We were there for a little over an hour and ended up not paying for my meal, but paid for my wife's and the drinks after I complained about everything. During our visit I had also seen and heard a few other customers complain about some of the same things that bugged us.\n\nAs I said before ............... Be afraid !"", 'The sign outside says SCONE, the servers all wear tshirts that say things like, ""Get Sconed"", or ""I Just Got Sconed"" - but mark my words - these are not scones but delicious Indian fry bread covered with powdered sugar/cinnamon sugar/plain that\'s larger than the size of a baby\'s head.  And I\'m talking a baby that was born by C-section, because it weighed 35lbs, as its mother ate these scones from Merritt\'s everyday, three meals a day for 9 months.\n\nThe place isn\'t much to look at.  Dark wood paneling that\'s sagging and peeling in places.  Your (nearly blind) grandmother\'s light fixtures.  And booths with tables jammed up so close to your body that they\'ll have to physically remove the table after you\'re done eating so that you can have more room to stretch out for the sugar coma that\'s about to follow.\n\nWe sat in the back booth facing the door, ready for the gunfight that we were pretty sure would happen during our Sunday morning brunch.  Our Prius was the only non-4 wheel drive in the parking lot (along with a Harley).  A guy stood outside the front door with one of his hands suspiciously hidden in his checkered shirt, looking at everyone who went by.  \n\nOrdered the Two Eggs with Bacon and Scone and a Denver Omelet with Scone.  About $8.75/ea.  ""The scones won\'t be too big, if they\'re a side with the breakfast,"" we reassured ourselves.  When the scones finally arrived - spilling over on a plate larger than half my ass - we  realized that our asses would be bigger than the scone by the time the meal was over.  The scones were delicious, having just been deep fried and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.  Each one came with a generous dollop of honey butter.  Despite our promise to eat only HALF of the scone, by the time the rest of our breakfast arrived, we\'d pretty much finished the entire thing.  \n\nThe omelet was a decent homemade omelet full of ingredients - what you\'d expect in a family restaurant - not a fancy omelet of the ""New American"" variety.  My hash browns were a little on the soggy and bland side but the bacon was great.  The restaurant had all the condiments on the table and a specialty ketchup we\'ve never seen before - infused with lemon and spices.  The condiments were clean, not spilling over and encrusted with flies, and the service was friendly and efficient.  Besides breakfasts the place also serves lunch and dinner and even late night, though at $7.75 for a Sirloin, as advertised on their white board, I\'m not sure how good the steak would be.  (It was $8.75 for the breakfast.)  And I\'m not sure what the crowd would be like later in the day.  Happily, however, the place doesn\'t serve alcohol.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

My Honey and I have made a quest of trying to find the best hot dogs in town, and for months we wouldn\'t try the same tent twice until we found this place and, call it love at first bite, we knew right away it was the best.\n \nAlthough I order my hot dog sans hot dog, or ""sin carne"" I promise it\'s just as good without the meat.

Excellent ramen! Good broth, fresh ingredients, and a generous portion.

The pork is fresh and lean and sliced consistently thin. The bamboo shoots are not the woody, canned variety, but was fresh. The broth is not overly spicy, but just enough to give a little kick and it was nice and creamy like a good tonkotsu broth should be.\n\nThe yakiniku was delicious. It had the right amount of grilled flavor in it and was not overly marinated which can produce a salty flavor.\n\nThe staff was very friendly. Most of my dealings were with the co-owner, Lori, but I did have interactions with two other of the staff and they were helpful and friendly.

(Samurai being the other.)', ""I can't believe I haven't reviewed Ikkyu before, as I am a frequent customer, and have been for years. Ikkyu is a small Japanese restaurant on the end of the shopping plaza where Lee Lees Oriental Supermarket is located. They have maybe 10 tables inside, and an outdoor patio that is covered for the short time of the year when eating outside isn't oppressively hot with another 4-5 tables. The menu includes bento boxes, rice bowls, a limited number of sushi rolls and salads. After the gym I love to go here and either get their spicy tuna don (which I order Volcano style-with eel sauce, tempura flakes, spicy mayo and dried seaweed flakes) or their ramen which is only offered Thursday-Sunday. So when you walk in looking for Ramen and don't see it on the menu, that is because it isn't on the menu. There will be a sign posted for Ramen on the counter with pictures and then you know you are in luck. Boy is this great ramen! I like the Tonkatsu Ramen best;  i've had all three and all are delicious. A special detail I especially like about Ikkyu ( which is silly I know) is they have a self served soda machine with 7-up, RC cola, ginger ale and lemonade( possibly root beer too). I love love love these choices so much. I usually drink water or green tea when I eat a dinner unless I get a cocktail. This to me is all my favorites from when I was a kid. \nBathroom's are single stall rooms for men and ladies, which are at the end of a hall way past the order counter. The place is small and a bit cramped for space. So many times when I am sitting customers ordering or inches from me. Also if you need to use the restroom, you often are waiting for another customer to vacate the restroom.That being said, I love the food here. For Japanese food in Tucson this it is my comfort food and reasonably priced.

The Cuban music playing at just the right level on the sound system, the aroma of garlic and braising pork, rice, toasting bread and simmering beans, the warm colors, the tile floors and wood tables, the photos and posters of Cuba on the walls; on each visit you\'ll likely notice some new detail.  Like the lyrical hum of some of the diners and staff speaking Spanish, a beautiful language that in this restaurant sounds especially so.  It sparkles in every sense of the word, from the greeting at the door, to the pristinely clean surroundings, to the stellar service to the flavors in the food.\n\nSEATING\nComfortable chairs at standard height (hooray) tables throughout.  Some tucked into alcoves, some in the center of the room, some in a separate room (a great spot for a private party).   My husband and I particularly appreciate that even if full house the seating is arranged in a way that one feels they have \'elbow room\'. \n\nSERVICE\nWelcoming, friendly, gracious, efficient, delightful.  This has been a perfect experience for us on each visit from the beautiful young woman who was covering the entire restaurant.  Top notch.\n\nMENU / FOOD / VALUE\nThe multi page menu is the same from opening at 11a through dinner service that ends at 9p.  You\'ll find appetizers, entrees, sandwiches and sides all of traditional Cuban food.\n\nDon\'t miss the soup list on the back page.  In addition to the delicious black bean soup served daily there is a special soup for each day of the week.  If you go on Thursdays, do not miss the garbanzo bean soup that has a wonderful full flavored broth with pork and potatoes.  Remember that tip.  And note if you order a sandwich you can substitute a cup of soup for the fries that come as normal side for only a $1.99 extra.  Leave the fries.  Order the soup.  You\'ll thank me.\n\nYou can\'t miss with anything on the menu.  The tostones con mojo (fried plantains with garlicky mojo sauce for dipping) are wonderful. ($3.99)  So are the black beans.  And the sweet plantains.  My husband loved the bacalau, a cod dish simmered with tomato and bell pepper sauce with potatoes.  ($11.99)   Braised pork shoulder asado with onions is served with a side of black beans mixed with rice and also yucca with garlic that is scrumptious.  (And a bargain at $9.99.)  You\'ll find shrimp dishes and classic chicken dishes, like arroz con pollo, and sandwiches including the ever popular Cubano.  Sandwiches (around $8) are large easily shared by two, and stand out not just for the perfectly crafted fillings but for the Cuban styled bread on which they are served.\n\nPortions are generous and we always eat very well here with leftovers to take away for just about $30 for two people and that includes a couple of beverages and always (always!) a dessert to share.  Look at the dessert card on the table (beverages on the flip side) and save room.  I recommend the Flan de Coco, a dense coconut flan drizzled with real caramel or the Cuban chocolate pudding. (Each about $4.00)\n\nLIBATIONS\nSoft drinks, bottled beers domestic and imported, a few wines by the glass and housemade Sangria ($4.50).  The Sangria is delicious.  So is the Cuban Espresso ($2.50) made with coffee brought in from Miami; the perfect counterpoint to any dessert.\n\nTHIS N THAT:\n\n1) PARKING: Private lot.\n\n2) ACCESSIBILITY: No marked accessible parking in the lot. There is a curb ramp accessing the sidewalk at the front door. Level iin and throughout. Single stall in loo likely too narrow for people who cannot stand and step in.\n\n3) 7 DAYS A WEEK:  It must be exhausting and daunting to be open every day of the week in a small restaurant ilke this.  Hats off to them!\n\n4) FOOD TRUCK TOO?:  Note a spiffy looking food trudk sometimes parked behind the restaurant.   Seems as if it is a mobile until for the Casa Blanca sandwhiches.', ""Due to my extensive travel history, I have built a very strong and picky tongue for authenticity. That being said, I can tell you Casablanca is the real damn deal. I'm about to tell you why. \n\nThe entire menu at Casablanca is filled with what you'd find at a typical restaurant in Havana. I recognized many dishes that I've dined on and they were all delicious, so it was hard for me to make a decision. During my first visit I bellied up to the world-famous Sandwich Cubano (roasted pork, ham, pickles, Swiss cheese and mustard on a Cuban style bread). Man, I tell you, it was SPOT ON. Reminded me of my trip years ago when I had my first one. The meat was roasted to perfection, delivered a dynamite of flavor and was too damn good to stop eating! If you try one thing here, this is it!\n\nOn another occasion I was served the Ropa Vieja (shredded beef in Cuban Creole sauce with onions and peppers. Served with white rice, black beans and sweet ripe plantains (maduros)). This also happens to be Cuba's national dish! Again, each bite took me back to Havana. Sweet, delicate and tender beef paired with fresh cooked rice and beans. The taste was outstanding. Boise lacks so many authentic cuisine but Casablanca reminds me that true food is there if you seek it. \n\nOn another note, I absolutely loved our waiter both times. He was very kindhearted and humorous, took time to inform us of what each dish consisted of, which was super helpful for my very Americanized husband (nothing wrong with that - he just doesn't have the palate for authentic food like I do!). \n\nIn a heartbeat, I recommend this to anyone who is tired of over-sweetened, sodium packed eateries that boast but fail to deliver genuine cuisine. Also, if you've never had Cuban food you are missing out on so much!!! And it's here, in little Boise so HEAD OVER AND SUPPORT THIS LOCAL BUSINESS that I love so dearly!"", 'I had been wanting to try this place out for quite a while, and for some reason never made the time. Located on overland, between orchard and Curtis, this place was delightful. I was looking forward to having tostones (fried plantains) again. Haven\'t had them since I was a kid living in Puerto Rico. They weren\'t as good as I remember them being as a child. I\'ll have to pick up some plantains the next time I see them at the grocery store and make my own. \n\nWe started with the tostones and Casablanca\'s chorizo croquetas. Described as ""six savory flour based rolls lightly breaded and fried to a golden brown. Available in three flavors: Ham, Cod fish, and Chorizo"". I love croquetas. The amazing ones from Bar Gernika/Manfreds come to mind. These were also delicious! Different, in a good way.\n\nI was going to order the Arroz con pollo (rice with chicken), but that\'s what my wife wanted to order, so I went with the ropa vieja. ""Affectionately called old clothes in Spanish. Shredded beef in Cuban creole sauce with onions and peppers. Served with white rice, black beans, and sweet ripe plantains."" This was very good. The sauce made this exceptionally tasty. The beans were some of the best I have had in a while. The only downfall, again, was the plantains. Everything else was quite good. My wife\'s dish was delicious, and I got to try my father in law\'s cubano sandwich. Really quite delicious. I highly recommend this place if you want to try something a little different.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

The sandwich was out of this world. The sausage was huge, the homemade mustard and ketchup tasted unbelievable, and the mound of sauerkraut was the cherry on top. Everything tasted simply incredible. The sandwich came with a small side salad, with a dressing that tasted like tzatziki sauce. The German potato salad was not overly mushy, and it actually tasted like potatoes. \n\nI ordered the Warsteiner Oktoberfest bier, which had beautiful color, and tasted great; however, it did have a big head on it. It went perfectly with my sandwich. What I also love about the bier is that they serve them in glasses with the bier names on them.\n\nThe service was friendly, but not very attentive.

I enjoyed it very much but one was plenty for me.  \n\nThe menu leans toward more traditional, heavy pub food, so I ordered the Ruben Salat (marinated beet salad) and I forgot to order the dressing on the side, but it was dressed perfectly anyway.  My friends and I also ordered the cabbage rolls special.  We were expecting something more like a stuffed cabbage roll, but these came as ground beef and cabbage encased in bread rolls.  It's a good thing we split the order, but even so, I ended up breaking it open and eating the center.  It was just had too much bread and I thought it overwhelmed the taste of the filling.\n\nThe atmosphere is open, loud, and boisterous so not a place for a quite conversation.

We wanted to go out to a pizza place and eat, play games, and enjoy our time. I looked up pizza with the highest ratings in our area and Diggs looked delicious and it didn't disappoint. The person working the counter ended up moving two tables together and we all could fit comfortably. \n\nI ordered one extra large pizza (pics attached) and although I didn't taste the pizza due to dietary restrictions, my family loved it. My kids and nephew were telling me how they want to come here all the time, which made me feel happy because I like to make my mom and kids happy. The pizza was extremely cheesy and the toppings were fierce. I got a salad and it was very large that I shared with my whole crew. \n\nThey have 2 liters for you to purchase and dine in customer get free bottles of water. Their ranch dressing was very good. \n\nThey have other food, too. I took my son home finger steaks and he enjoyed them. There aren't any games, and is extremely small space, but the people working there took good attentive care of us and made the best of the space. \n\nWe will surly visit again. It's on the other side of town, so it won't be often, but we will go over there again for this place. \n\nThank you Digg's Pizza staff!"", ""I've been seeing Diggs pop up on Yelp's delivery suggestions. I wondered where the heck this said pizza place was, and who knew it was only 5 minutes from my house! Possible the greatest discovery of the month, for more reasons that it's convenient location. \n\nI prefer to keep things simple when testing out new pizza joints. Call it an entrance exam. If a pizza joint can't produce a decent pepperoni pizza is it even really a pizza joint? So after examining Digg's very extensive and intriguing menu all I ordered was a large pepperoni ($16.44). Their prices are kind of random but very reasonable for the quality and size. Holy smokes it was delicious! They definitely don't go light on the pepperoni! My pizza was nearly completely covered. Also, there was so. much. CHEESE! I had to use two hands to eat because if I only used one everything would fall off and all I'd get was a slice of bread covered in marinara sauce. Such good pizza I can't believe I didn't know this gem of a place was only 3 miles from me!\n\nNow that Digg's has passed my entrance exam, I look forward to trying one of their more exotic pizza flavors."", ""As a restaurant owner, I love the opportunity to leave positive reviews on other restaurants that stand out above the rest.  Today we tried Diggs Pizza for the first time.  We are always looking for new venues and we are so extremely pleased we found Diggs online.\n\nFirst off, we were happy they deliver out in far South Boise.  When we called the gentleman that took our order was polite and informative.  The delivery took around 45 minutes which is totally acceptable due to where we live.  The gal that delivered the goods was very happy.  The first thing I noticed when the delivery was handed to me was how heavy a small pizza, medium pizza and a salad was.  The first bites were nothing short of incredible.  The pizzas were loaded with probably double the toppings of any other pizza we have every had.  Everything was so fresh and amazingly good.  Let's just say that after two slices I was stuffed.  My wife and son also couldn't believe what we were indulging.  Let's just say that we never made it to the awesome looking salad, but we will tomorrow.  That is a meal in itself.\n\nBottom line, this is a 10 star restaurant.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

The quiche was absolutely delicious and worth the wait. Fresh and hot out of oven - it's savory and rich. The fruits on side were refreshing. \n\nHubby thought his meaty bagel sandwich was good but could be warmer - maybe the kitchen finished making the bagel sandwich first and waited for the quiche to cook in the oven.

The garden is directly next door to the Old Penitentiary east of downtown Boise. Parking is free and abundant. \n\nThe gardens have clearly evolved over the years with the older exhibits lacking the detail and labeling of the newer ones. The classic English and meditation gardens are lush and attractive, but lack much description. The newer sections have much more information and structure. \n\nThe garden is a bit awkward to navigate especially with morning field trips and classes. It can get hot here during the summer so be prepared. This would be a nice combination trip with the penitentiary in cool weather. With so much natural beauty in and around Boise, there is just too much competition outside the garden!', 'An old guard tower from the abandoned State Penitentiary caught my eye as I admired a sculpture in the Idaho Botanical Garden.  It took me back for a moment, to think of people once incarcerated at this spot where I was enjoying the freedom to roam a beautiful place created among stark surrounds.  My husband and I went in for what we thought might be an hour visit and ended up enjoying more than two hours with so much to see.  With a modest entry fee, multiple garden themes and good accessibility this is recommended for Boise visitors of all ages for however much or little time you choose to spend.  A tip if you\'re there in warm months, as we were, take sun protection and water!\n\nENTRY\nYou enter the garden site from the grounds of the old penitentiary.  (Also open for visiting.)  We were confused about how to get into the garden itself, so offer this heads up: turn right at the small garden administration building and you\'ll see a kiosk to pay your admission ($5 for adult) fee to the garden then continue driving up until you get to the gravel lot just outside the garden\'s entry.\n\nLAYOUT\nThe garden is on 33 acres leased from State with about 15 acres developed into roughly 15 different themed areas that rise in elevation from lower to middle and upper gardens demonstrating four habitats.  As examples: on the lower (entry level) you\'ll find English and Rose gardens, then rising up through areas like Herb and Meditation and Children\'s gardens and on up to Lewis and Clark Native gardens.  The latter, installed in 2006 I learned, was my favorite with the chirping sounds of  big covey of quail running through the plantings, a round house structure with a plant roof and at the highest point a great view out over the old Penitentiary and towards the city.   \n\nSCULPTURES & ART\nRecycled material sculptures, bronze sculptures and other art installations are throughout the garden created an outdoor gallery of sorts among the plantings. \n\nPATHWAYS\nSlopes can be steep in some places given the natural elevation of the site but the folks who designed the garden have done a good job of leveling out the cross slopes of the pathways so people pushing strollers or using wheelchairs should find them navigable.  Surfacing of most, but not all, of the garden is firm and stable and installed it seems with the idea of being appropriate to the theme of that particular garden area.  As examples: cobblestone pavers in the English Garden, brick pavers in the Rose Garden outlook, hard pack dirt surfaces on some other trails and so on.  The most accessible surfacing is at the higher elevation gardens with broom swept cement.  The flaws for accessible connectivity include the grassy meditation garden, some rough patches of gravel covered pathways between areas and that the parking lot is loose gravel to be navigated before getting to the firm surfacing at the entry.  (Anyone who has pushed a stroller across deep grass or loose gravel knows why that doesnt\' work for a wheelchair or crutches either.)\n\nUNIQUE TREEHOUSE\n""Woohoo worthy"" is a treehouse that seems to have been recently installed at the Children\'s Garden.  That treehouse is set up in universal access design that allows children using wheelchairs  to have level in access from a pathway and participate along with all others.  Very nice.  Having seen children with disabilities being left on the sidelines again and again, this was a delightful element.  Of course, this works too for children beng pushed in strollers.  And PS - for parents using wheelchairs, as in my acquaintance whose legs were severed in Iraq, it is equally cool for him to be able to join his toddler son there as all other dads might do.  Everyone wins.\n \nSEASONAL EVENTS\n\nSUMMER: Hosts occasional public concerts about which we heard a lot of kudos from locals. Also other monthly events (like cooking and food showcase) that are public.   \n\nWINTER:  Lit for the season with thousands of lights in ""Garden Glow"" which starts on Thanksgiving Day and runs through January 5.  Santa themed elements are included for kids and kids at heart.  Glow event is evenings only, roughly 6p - 9p.  (Higher entry fee may apply?  Check with the garden.)  Open Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve and Day, New Years\' Eve and Day. \n\nTHIS N THAT:\n\n1) SWEAT & FUNDING:  Land is leased by a private non profit from the State of Idaho and is funded by donations and entry fees; receives no government funding.  The gardens, all designed and cultivated since 1981, are lovingly maintained by staff and volunteers.  \n\n2) HOURS VARY WITH SEASON:  March - November: 7 days a week roughly 9a to 9p (or dusk whichever is sooner).  Check garden site for winter hours.  \n\n3) FREE ENTRY MORNING STROLL:  During some months there are no entry fees from 7:30a - 9:00a.

They don\'t put a dab of wasabi under the fish like you would find on 95% of sushi in Japan, but most places here don\'t do this, and rather in the American tradition, let you put the wasabi in your soy sauce dish to taste.

If you've never been, imagine the Hyde Park neighborhood but with newer buildings and located on the east side of town...and you have Bown Crossing!)\n\nOn to Flatbread - \nDue to it's location, you can come here on a weekend night and not have to worry about the hassle of parking or fighting a crowd like you would at a downtown restaurant. We came in around 8:30-ish and were seated right away. Our server came up to our table within a minute after being seated and gave us water and asked if we had any questions about the drink menu. Our server was so warm, friendly, and pleasant to talk to!\n\nI ordered a cabernet to drink thinking it was $8 a glass. To my surprise when I got the bill I was only charged $4 - I suppose we unintentionally went during happy hour, score! For food I ordered a Gluten Free Farmhouse flatbread. It had a red onion jam, goat cheese, pancetta, asparagus and arugula on it. SO yummy. I highly recommend trying this. I also really enjoyed their gluten free crust, it was a little crispy on the outside and sort of chewy and soft towards the center. All together, my meal cost right around $15. For a good dinner out AND a nice drink? I'd say that's a steal. \n\nOther things-\n- They don't have vegan cheese, but all of their flatbreads have so many other things on them that if you have to bypass the cheese you're not missing out, you'll still really enjoy it (IMO).\n- They have a little patio (looking forward to checking this out in warmer months)!\n- And as I noted with my glass of wine, they have an awesome happy hour (Mon-Fri 4pm-6pm and Fri-Sat 9-close // 50% off wine and drafts)!"", 'UPDATE: I sent my review below to the company this afternoon and the general manager of the Bown Way responded to me a few minutes ago. I never expected anyone to respond on a Sunday and within just a few hours of contacting them.\n\nShe apologized and said she had already followed up with some of the employees at the restaurant and invited me to come back again.\n\nThat\'s the kind of customer service I appreciate and the reason I\'m bumping them up to five stars, the same rating I gave their downtown Boise restaurant.\n\nI really like the company, so it was disappointing when they didn\'t measure up to my expectations. I have complete confidence that I\'ll have a different experience when I return. Thanks, Flatbread, for listening and getting back to me.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nEarlier, I gave them a three-star rating:\nIf I hadn\'t had such great experiences at the downtown Boise and Bend locations, I doubt I would make a return trip.\n\nI ordered a ""Pick Two"" lunch with a sopressata and capicolo pizza and a deconstructed Italian pizza.\n\nThe pizza was undercooked, which is hard to do in a high-temperature, wood-burning oven. The top of the crust was still doughy and the bottom was likewise underdone. The ingredients, though, were fantastic, as always. The salad was delicious.\n\nWhen I walked in through the doors leading to the outdoor seating, I walked around front and didn\'t realize a woman standing next to the bar was a hostess. At the other locations, I\'ve never been confused about that. Unlike the servers who have attire identifying the restaurant, the hostess was wearing civilian clothes and didn\'t immediately greet me. I looked at her for a moment, she looked back and then asked if she could help me.\n\nI love the open kitchens of Flatbread Neapolitan Pizzeria. I enjoy watching the flames inside the oven and watching the cooks stretch dough and make pizzas in full view. The downside for the restaurant is when the cook is between pizzas and he spends his time texting. And texting some more. And then has a server come and look at his phone and either text or play a game. And then another server comes over and they\'re laughing at whatever is on the phone. I guess there wasn\'t anything more important to do. I wish I got paid at work to text.\n\nI gathered that the hostess isn\'t the manager because she walked past Mr. Texter and didn\'t say a word. Nor did he hide what he was doing.\n\nThe Bown Way shop is beautiful and I really like the outdoor seating and the fire pit for when it cools off.

I thought the floor layout (especially considering the small size of the place) was spot on. There weren\'t many customers inside on a Saturday evening, and once everyone left, it almost felt like you were sitting at your own personal coffee shop. \n\nParking is limited, but I feel like it is proportional to how many people can physically fit inside the place. There is an outdoor patio area in the front, but I really enjoyed the cozy vibe inside that I would recommend you sit in there (at least until it gets nice out). I\'m sure it gets loud inside when that thing is packed with customers, but when there\'s no one there except you, it\'s very peaceful, ESPECIALLY after being at the Boise mall and dealing with people, parking, and the general chaos there.\n\nCoffee tasted good, but to be honest, I\'m not experienced enough in the coffee game to tell the difference between any of these local coffee places. They also have premade burritos, pastries, and donuts up front by the counter. Prices were a little high IMO, but if you\'re dining inside I feel like it\'s well worth it. Staff was super friendly, no complaints at all.\n\nOne small recommendation I\'d give is to have prices next to the food in the little counter, makes you feel less like a peasant for asking how much everything is in there lol.\n\nOverall, this is 5 stars EASY. My favorite coffee place so far has been Flying M in Nampa, which does get very busy / loud at times that can be a turn off for some (even though they have awesome latte art there).

I like a restaurant that asks gentlemen to remove their caps before dining. I\'m old school and when I take my wife out for an anniversary celebration and spend $200, I expect the right sort of atmosphere. When Ruth\'s confirmed my reservation via email, they included this message: ""For the dining pleasure of all guests, our dress code is Business Casual. We ask you to kindly remove your hat when entering the restaurant."" \n\nWe\'ve seen caps before at Ruth\'s but haven\'t said anything. This time, a guy sat directly in my line of view with his hat on the entire evening, and I did say something. I complained to my waiter who punted by saying, ""Our General Manager would certainly take care of the matter, but he\'s gone home for the night."" There were three well-dressed folks at the front desk who must have been too afraid to say anything to the offending party. With only four tables occupied on a Saturday evening, I sincerely believe that this location will put profit ahead of principle.\n\nI filled out a survey from Ruth\'s three days ago and asked that someone get back to me about this issue. So far, no one has.', 'I came here tonight to celebrate getting engaged to my amazing girlfriend.  I made reservations early in the week and they asked me if I was celebrating anything special.  I told them it depended on whether or not my girlfriend said yes, :) and she did.  They called me earlier today and confirmed the reservation and all went well.\n\nWe were both seated promptly.  Although our reservation was at 9:30pm, I thought more people would be there.  In the section we sat in, there were only 4 tables/booths being used out of maybe 20 tables? \n\nI ordered for my girlfriend and the waiter was kind enough to encourage us to try the herb roasted mushrooms verses the ordinary sautéed mushrooms.  Good call.  I felt the mushrooms were the best thing there.  I ordered the Ribeye and I ordered my girlfriend the New York steak.  We also ordered the Wedge Salad which was awesome, if you like bleu cheese, bacon and walnuts.  We split that and for sides we ordered the mac and cheese and mushrooms as stated above.\n\nI have been to Ruth Chris many times in San Diego before and I didn\'t get the same experience in Boise as I remember in San Diego.  This may only be my point of view but one of the ways I consider some restaurants to be worthy of $150 dollar meals is the professional level of balanced service.  Good waiters know how to take care of you and not over impose.  They know when to talk and when to just come by and fill drinks and realize you are in a conversation.  I have to say I was disappointed that my ice tea and water were empty 80% throughout my dinner.  My waiter at one point did ask if I wanted another ice tea and I did say no but that should mean you better make sure the water stays full.  Their glasses were maybe 10 ounce glasses and they were literally one drink glasses.  I do admit I do drink more then most people but that is how I view great service.  The funny thing was waiters were standing around looking at the 4 tables and I didn\'t feel it was appropriate to raise my hand like I was in 3rd grade.  My waiter was taking care of my table and another table out of the 4 tables.  The other waiters were focused on their one table and would walk by my empty glass of water and it just seemed like ""I am taking care of my table"" and thats all that matters.  I literally left my dinner thirsty.  Not good.\n\nSteaks:\nI thought my Ribeye was flavorful and I know most Ribeyes have a little more gristle but I would say 30% of my 16 oz steak was fat.  My girlfriend had the New York and she said it was just average.\n\nMushrooms:\nAmazing.\n\nMac & Cheese\nI wouldn\'t order it.  It wasn\'t that good.  Wish I would have gotten some type of potato.\n\nTemperature:\nSo hot in there.  I went there on a day where we were in the 80\'s and the restaurant was hot.  I was sweating and I could have drank a gallon of water.  It was perfect for my lady so I didn\'t complain but even the waiter was complaining of the heat.\n\nOnce my fiancé (first time saying that) and I were done, we wanted to leave.  As our glasses were both empty, my waiter continued talking to a table for at least 10 minutes (which feels like an hour when you are full, thirsty, hot and tired) and I so wanted him to come over to pack up the food and give me my check.  He filled my water one more time (3/4\'s full) as I quickly chugged it.\n\nOverall, I have been torn whether to give 2 or 3 stars.  If I am paying a good amount for dinner, I have to be a little more critical.  All in all, food was ok and service was not that great.  Also if you are asking me if I am celebrating a special event, why ask if you aren\'t going to do anything?\n\nMaybe my experience was isolated and hopefully there are many good servers that work there.  My waiter was really nice but wished he would have come around more.', 'This review is not about the food, which is part of the problem.  I am a professional in her 50\'s and enjoy a fine restaurant such as Barbacoa and Chandlers to name a few.  I also enjoy meeting a friend or two for a cocktail before leaving city center for home at the end of the day. When I heard Ruth\'s Chris was opening in downtown Boise I was delighted and eager to add Ruth\'s to my list of favorite dining places.  To ""get my toes wet"" I decided to meet a friend there for happy hour and sample their atmosphere and food.  I arrived at 5p.m. and found that there was a reason for the empty lounge I had glimpsed from the sidewalk.  They have a policy that is giving a very bad impression of them.  \nI found that the only place you can get appetizers with your drinks is at the bar top which is only about 25 chairs long. There are four lounge couches back to back by the window that you can order a drink at, but no appetizers can be served there.  The REST of the lounge area, which consist of approximately 7 booths and 5 tables, are fully set for dinner with crystal and white linen with little reserved signs on every one! Since the bar and the lounge couches were full a waitstaff told me we could sit at a table but they could only serve us a drink.  So, confused and wanting to stay we sat at the closest table.  We sat and sat for a full 10 minutes while seeing waitstaff pass by and pass by.  We finally came to the conclusion that they were instructed to NOT serve someone sitting at the tables unless they had come for a full dinner.  It was an uncomfortable experience that I was not use to, especially in such a highly rated place. Finally, we left without being waited on and went down the block to the new place ""The Mode"" which turned out to be a wonderful little place for drinks and appetizers!\nUnwilling to let one experience sour things, we decided to meet again at Ruth\'s Chris last night, (Wed. night) to give it one more try.  I didn\'t want to have the same experience so left work early and got there at 4:40pm.  I was amazed, the bar top was full already!  10 minutes into happy hour and the bar top was full.  The lounge couches all had people sitting on them, but only four people, one person per lounge couch.  Since there was room for at least three people per couch, one kindly elderly gentleman offered for me to sit down.  I texted my fiance that it was full but I was sitting on a couch and would wait for him before figuring out what to do. Again, all the tables and booths in the lounge area, NOT the restaurant area, were UNOCCUPIED and fully set for dinner with crystal and white linen with a reserved sign on each one.  \nI found out that the elderly gentleman was meeting his daughter and son in law for appetizers and cocktails before moving on to Chandlers and then ending up at Angell\'s.  He was nonplus about what to do because he had just found out that appetizers were served at the bar top only.  I told him this was the second time this had happened to me and told him about The Mode and its delightful appetizers and cocktail.  He took my suggestion and headed there with his party. The man sitting across from me in the couch area  told me he had arrived there at 4:26 and had found the door to the lounge locked so he went down the block to look at North Face for a couple of minutes before coming back.  He said he got back to Ruth\'s Chris at 4:36 and the bar top was full!  He made the crack they must of been hiding around the corner because ten minutes earlier there was no one around.\nAs I sat there on the lounge cushion waiting for my fiance, I saw MULTIPLE parties and people come in and were told that appetizers were only served at the bar top.  They all left because the people sitting on the couches were waiting for an opening at the bar top already.\nIt was NOT an inviting atmosphere at all.  I do not experience that kind of awkward situation very often and they need to change their policy about lounge serving ASAP or lose customers by the dozens.  To have a lounge not being used as a lounge and so many people turning and leaving will only create a bad image for them.  It could have a snowball effect.  I would suggest not to hae happy hour at all if they are going to limit it to 25 customers because the 125 people that leave an empty lounge because of no service will feel slighted.  It was the first time I have felt that their attitude was not happy to have us, but we were lucky to be there.  Bad publicity if you ask me.\nThank goodness they are in an area of good restaurants because we walked down the street and had a good time with good food at Matador\'s.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,80.0

No one here pulls it off to my liking. And barring a pub opening up that\'s run by and caters to a predominant and demanding British/Irish crowd (yeah, right), I\'m saving my money for other meals.\n\nI visited twice early in their existence and criticized them on a different foodie site. Recently errands led me to the Maclife strip mall it usually takes residence in out in the parking lot, and it happened to be there. I figured ""Why not?"" and hoped that the three years that had passed had led to some improvements.\n\nNope. Strike three. This place has the exact same problem as Parrilla Grill. Sounds good. Looks good (I hate it when there\'s an excessive amount of batter on the fish, but the layer here is kept pretty thin). But bland as all hell. Neither the fish nor the batter did anything for me. Without the ketchup and tartar sauce provided, my taste buds may as well have been hopped up on novocaine when eating here. It takes a certain kind of fish/batter combo to completely neutralize malt vinegar, but the Kilted Kod\'s managed to make it possible for me. Each time there I\'ve poured excessive amounts of vinegar to elicit taste in the fish but to little avail. I can\'t fathom trying to survive on the one packet of vinegar provided for takeout. \n\nI guess wanting some hand-cut fries out of a trailer might be asking too much, but in the local hierarchy of frozen fries they\'re in the average category. I expected higher quality out of a place that only offers three kinds of food.\n\nThey appear to have a good chunk of regulars, and maybe this is considered good quality for Boise by the lifelong locals. But for me this doesn\'t pass muster. I hate pulling the ""I lived in (insert city here) so I know what good (insert cuisine here) is"" card, but in cases like this it\'s unavoidable. Living most of my life in a large port city, I was used to a steady diet of either having Alaskan or Icelandic cod at legitimate British/Irish pubs or having whatever was market fresh at a fish market that served fish and chips. So to go from that to my experiences at the Kilted Kod (who is playing off the angle that they\'re like fish and chips you\'d get in Britain) is too much of a dropoff in quality for me. The head guy told me that they use Alaskan cod, but I\'ll be damned if that\'s not the most tasteless Alaskan cod I\'ll ever come across. Admittedly the value of the meal ($7) gave me pause about his statement considering I can pay upwards of over twice that for the same thing in Los Angeles, but I\'ll take his word for it.\n\nI feel a little bad about this one because they seem like genuinely nice people. But there\'s been talk here and elsewhere about a lack of good fish and chips in town, and I wanted to throw in my $.02 as I think this holds true, especially if you\'re a transplant from a larger city and/or a port city. They claim to be the real deal, and that\'s what intrigued me about them more than any other place that offered fish and chips around here. But it turned out to be fools gold.', ""I was mad craving something greasy this past Friday and remembered Kilted Kod typically hangs out at the Journey Church parking lot on this day. My last experience here last year was fantastic. I was really hoping for the same outcome but it fell just a tad short off. \n\nI ordered the same 2 piece Alaskan cod n chips ($10.00) as before, this time adding a side of homemade coleslaw ($1.50) and my husband (not a fish fan, weird dude) got the 2 piece chicken n chips ($12.00). The portions seem generous, but for the price it's okay. \n\nMy cod pieces were definitely greasier than before. My first bite literally felt like eating fried grease. It also tasted rather old. Same with the fries. I didn't feel very good afterwards. The chicken strips were huge! I had a couple bites and they were awesome. I thought the coleslaw was rather watered down and tasteless. It definitely could have used more sugar or salt to enhance flavor. \n\nAll in all it satisfied by yearn for an oily dinner but it was a little too much this time. I hate to have to drop my rating from 5 to 3 stars when my expectations were so high based on a wonderful previous experience. I'm a little weary to promise a return - at least next time I'll have an idea of what to expect."", 'I was out on a ""Pokewalk"" on my lunch hour downtown.  I had been hanging out at Capitol Park, but needed to head back to the office.  Out to grab more Pokestops on my route back, I walked up 6th and waited to cross State.  I saw it.. the red food truck.. I wondered.. could it be?  No, said that negative Nelly in back of my brain.. it\'s probably someone else.. but.\nThe light changed and I crossed the street.. I heard someone say \'fish & chips\'.. and yes.. oh yes.. THE KILTED KOD was within my grasp! I have been trying to make it to an event to try their eats for some time, but it just hadn\'t worked.. now.. here they were. \nI looked at my watch.. it was going to be a tight squeeze to get food and get back to the office.. but I had to, I tell you.. I  HAD TO.   Quickening my step I popped into line just before a woman and four kids.. scanning the menu I made my choice.  Surf & Turf.  2 pieces of fish, 2 chicken strips and fries.  I said YES to malt vinegar and tartar sauce, and faced with the choice of BBQ sauce or Ranch.. went with Ranch for my chicken.  \nWhile I waited I chased down a couple of close Pokestops.  I then received the styrofoam box of (what I hoped were) NOMS and hit the pavement as quick as I could headed the six blocks to work.  As I walked I feared my lunch was suffering from being enclosed .. I had visions of sog brought on by condensation..  Thankfully my fears were nullified. When I opened the box.. \nI put up a photo.. it bears proof to how well the food stood up to a six block jaunt.. the all items remained crispy and hot.   To be honest, I hadn\'t planned on lunch, I\'d had a good snack mid morning- but when opportunity knocks sometimes you just have to go for it. \nThe fish.. oh my.. the glorious cod, firm, flaky, juicy.. cooked to perfection.. in a batter nicely spiced, but leaving room for augmentation with tartar sauce (by the by, whoever their vendor is.. or is it handmade.. the tartar sauce is great!).  The chicken strips, also battered and cooked to perfection, with a slightly different seasoning profile.  The only let down for me was the Ranch dressing.. but that is all about perspective..

I was very happy to see the ""no smoking"" sign on the door when I entered.  I was also pleased to find happy hour is a double for $3- M-F 4-7.  \n\nThis particular evening table service was provided.  The server was friendly and quick.  After a couple of drinks, we thought it would be smart to order some food and were surprised by the menu options available- sandwiches, salads, and burgers.  One friend ordered the spicy chicken sandwich ($6.75), while i shared a prime rib dip ($7.75)with the other friend. Both sandwiches came with a side salad.   \n\nThis being somewhat of a dive bar, we really didn\'t have high hopes for the food but were hungry.  Well we were VERY surprised at what we got.  The salad had romaine lettuce with tomatoes and grated cheese (no iceberg in sight!).  The chicken sandwich wasn\'t a fried chicken patty but a chicken breast with a tasty sauce.  The dip was an amazing amount of sliced prime rib, not deli meat in the least, served up on a tasty roll with a very nice au jus.  \n\nI came here for the happy hour; I will return for the food!', 'Well this is one of our go to neighborhood dive bars. We typically come in on Sundays for their build your own omelets and bloodys! Staff is very friendly and the owner, Janet is usually in the back cooking. She comes out to say hi to the patrons as well. Gives you that local vibe which is always a great touch. The have pool tables here, so while the wait for food on Sundays can sometimes be long, you can keep busy with some pool. Highly recommend if you are in the bench area. Great little spot!', 'I\'ve always loved Janet\'s...until tonight. We went in for last call trivia (our first time doing trivia at Janet\'s). When we arrived, we ordered beers and asked for glasses of water. The waitress told us that because of the high volume of people they expected for trivia, they only sold bottles of water on Wednesday nights. Her excuse was, their ice machine couldn\'t keep up with the amount of mixed drinks the bar makes, plus ice water for the customers. We were fine with that (my friends and I all work in the restaurant industry, and we know sometimes certain appliances - like ice machines - can\'t always handle the rushes). So we asked for plain old tap water, with no ice. \n\nThe waitress told us that wasn\'t allowed and the only way we could get water was to buy bottles of water. Umm, what? Are you kidding me? I\'m not familiar with Idaho water laws in relation to restaurants, but...I have never, EVER, in all my time working in restaurants heard of a business refusing to give a table TAP WATER. \n\nNot to mention, a few minutes later, we saw her taking out big glasses of what was unmistakably ice water to other tables. And, it wasn\'t all that busy tonight. I\'ve seen it way more packed at Janet\'s than it was this evening, and I\'ve been able to get a glass of water - with ice! - during busy nights. \n\nSo we were pretty irritated, but willing to get over it, because the trivia was fun and the beers were great. \n\nAt the end of our night, we asked to close our tabs, and only then did the waitress tell us, ""We have to add a dollar charge onto your cards, since you\'re using cards instead of cash tonight, just so you know.""\n\nI\'ve been going to Janet\'s for years. They have a $10 minimum on cards, which I feel is pretty standard and fair. I have never once been charged an extra dollar to use a card during my times there. When we asked the waitress about it, she said the company policy has been in effect for two years, and that the employees get in a lot of trouble if they don\'t add the amount onto credit/debut card tabs (which apparently goes to cover the cost of running cards in the first place).\n\nFirst of all - if Janet\'s wanted to be a cash only bar, whether just for trivia nights or for any transaction, that needed to be said at the very beginning of the night - NOT as we were trying to leave and didn\'t have cash on us. It was only $1, but the fact that no one told us about it...and didn\'t give us the chance at the beginning of the night to, say, go get cash for our tabs...that\'s not right. \n\nSecond, the fact that it\'s been ""company policy"" and yet, none of us has ever been charged this? And we\'ve been going for years? I call bullshit. If you\'re trying to make some extra money off the people who come in for trivia nights, Janet, that\'s a pretty poor way to say thank you to the customers who come in and keep your bar busy for a few hours. \n\nThird, I\'ve worked for all different kinds of restaurants - corporate and locally/family-owned. Even in the locally owned restaurants, we never, EVER charged people for choosing to use a credit/debit card over cash. \n\nWhen we asked the waitress why we were being charged extra when we\'ve been coming to Janet\'s for years and have never had that happen, she said ""Oh, they probably just assumed you knew about the charge, so they just added it without telling you.""\n\nEven if that were remotely true, what an awful business practice!!! ""Hmm, these people come in and spend their hard earned money buying drinks and food at our bar - let\'s sneak an extra dollar here and there without saying a damn word, and see if we get caught!""\n\nThe waitress was very pleasant, and I realize none of this is her fault - she doesn\'t make the rules - however, the fact that she kept adding charge after charge, for no reason she could adequately explain, was completely and utterly ridiculous. And taking tap water out to your other tables, after telling someone you\'d only bring them bottled water you\'d have to charge them for? Not okay. \n\nLike I said, I\'m in the restaurant industry and I know how it is. I\'m usually pretty lenient on servers when I go out to eat and drink, because you never know if they\'re getting their asses kicked or are struggling in some way. But what we experienced tonight was terrible. \n\nNeedless to say, I\'m extremely disappointed in Janet\'s - a place I\'ve always enjoyed going to in the past. We won\'t be coming back, and you can be damn sure we\'ll be letting others know about the terrible service we received tonight.']",0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,1.0,30.0

This is my 408th review on Yelp. \n\nOk, all that may be a little dramatic(a little), but it\'s kinda true! Last night, the kids and I wanted a snack, yet Dad didn\'t want to go to the store or go bake something, so I remembered seeing Amie\'s (our Yelp embassador) review and I thought I should try it. \n\nThe app is amazingly easy to use. Right now we in Boise only have one flavor, chocolate chip. A box of 4 is $10 and you have a small delivery fee $2.99 and I tipped so about $15 for 4 cookies. The order was simplistic. You then get an email or text alerts (you chose) then you sit and anxiously wait. What did I just do?!? Did I really order cookies this late in the evening? Oh, yes-I-did! \n\nThe text messages kept me updated and I walked out to the car where I was handed these steamy, melt-in-your-mouth, addictive, heavy, large, warm cookies! Within 30 minutes of ordering, I had my cookies. \n\nGetting them in the house, I thought the box was awfully heavy. They were perfectly cooked, melted wonderfully, and amazing tasting. Seriously. I couldn\'t finish one and saved it for the next day. I warmed the cookie up and it was still just as good.  All 5 of us mmmmm\'d as we ate them. It was the quietest I\'ve seen my kids in, well, forever! \n\nAs Amie says in her March 2018 review, it\'s over the top... and lifes never the same, I agree and that\'s what\'s awesome about it! Give them a try. They deliver until 2am!', ""2.5 Stars now. I've been ordering cookies from Chip for about 1.5 years now, ever since my friend first brought back a box of their delicious Biscoff chip cookies from a work trip to Idaho. The cookies were so good that I was excited to discover they ship nationwide. \n\nI've tried several of their flavor of the month cookies, and while I haven't loved all of them, I couldn't deny the quality of their cookies and service. I always received my cookies expediently and without issue. Until recently that is.\n\nA few weeks ago I ordered their current cookie of the month flavor- the Snickershoedle chip, described as a snickerdoodle cookie stuffed with Biscoff cookie butter. I ordered 2 boxes and received the first box after a short delay, which wasn't actually Chip's fault but due to postal service being delayed in general due to protests. However, when my box did arrive it was damaged. Again, this isn't necessarily Chip's fault as they did have a fragile sticker on the box. But once I opened the box I realized two of the cookies were broken into pieces, and the other two, which were lopsided in shape, started crumbling into pieces as soon as I opened the wrapper. One of the cookies also didn't have much cookie butter filling in it, as advertised. \n\nJust as concerning was the shoddy wrapping that was done this time around. The cookies were wrapped but instead of being sealed like they used to be, the wrapping was taped together. To paint you a picture, the cookie and the packaging basically looked like how cookies your friend who doesn't bake often would make and send to you, and not how you would expect a store bought package of cookies or bakery cookies to look. \n\nThe last problem I had, which I don't entirely blame Chip Cookies for this specific issue, but wanted to bring up to highlight how unfortunate this entire recent experience was, is how I never recieved my second box of cookies. Usually when I order more than one package of cookies, they tape the boxes together and I receive my entire order together. That didn't happen this time around, and when I got the email notification that my order had been delivered and completed without mention of the other missing half of my order, I became concerned. I emailed right away, and I will say they did respond and work on figuring out the issue. A couple days later, after I emailed again, I was told their delivery specialist forgot to send the second box of cookies I ordered, so they offered to send me a new package or refund. And since I wasnt happy with the cookies I did receive, I decided on a refund.\n\nI'll end this review by saying I would like to order from Chip Cookies again some day, especially when they start selling their delicious Biscoff chip flavor cookies again, but I know I will be hesitant to do so given this past experience."", ""My friend went to Idaho for a business trip and he brought a box of these cookies back to the office to share. My friend said he was looking for local dessert places when this place popped up on his feed, so he decided to drop by. He said the store was setup in a way where he could see them baking the cookies in front of him. After seeing them make the cookies, he asked what kinds of cookies they had left and they told him they only make two types of cookies a day. He ended up buying a box with both types- chocolate chip and biscoff cookies. \n\nThe box came with 4 giant cookies, each the size of about three regular-sized cookies. And I absolutely loved the biscoff cookie, which had white chocolate & cookie butter chunks! It was so good that when my friend said they do orders online and ship nationwide I knew I had to order some for myself. And because one box is $10 while shipping was $15, I of course ordered two boxes to make it more worth it in my head. And I'm glad I did because I just got an email saying they would stop making the biscoff flavor soon and move onto a different flavor cookie. \n\nAnyways, here's what you need to know: Amazing giant gourmet cookies that are absolutely worth the price of shipping & handling!""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0

The Boise Fry Company offers several types of fresh cut fries and burgers in fun environment.  The staff was pretty laid back, but made some very good food.  The place was pretty minimalist aside from a few TVs.  It was very clean and there was plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.\n\nStarting with the fries - my russet curly fries were good.  They give you hot, plain fries and you take your order over to the seasoning bar.  They have a dozen different salts and other seasonings to dress up your fries.  There is also 8 or so dipping sauces to try out.  The end result is a very good fry, but nothing out of this world. Perhaps some of the other varieties are a little more interesting. The burger here was quite good - way better than the fries.  It was a fresh griddled burger on a potato bun.  The meat has a pretty interesting taste to it - kind of spicy.  I really liked the fry sauce that went great on the burger. The burger with fries was almost too much for lunch!  It was around $10 for a combo meal so a very fair price for a nice, fresh meal.\n\nThis is a fun place to try if you are visiting - they have a ton of info and pretty good food.', 'We\'d been craving burgers ... but more than that we were craving fries this evening --those perfectly cut, crispy fried golden carbo sticks that are very bad for the body & manna for the foodie soul... where should we go for such fare? Why BFC of course, right? They serve fries with burgers on the side! Made to order for our purposes tonight it seemed. Unfortunately not. The fries we were served were soggy, greasy, limp, and  tasteless ... a few were even undercooked. Dollops of sauce can only do so much to save a meal. The bison burgers were dripping with grease to the extent that i had to wipe mine off including the _top_ of the bun. The plates on which the food rested were wet. Clearly, our food was plated without an ounce of care or QC. \nAdding insult to injury, three oblivious patrons each accompanied by a dog - with one of them boldly, unapologetically off-leash - arrived at the door while we were mid-meal on the patio. The off-leash dog proceeded to saunter right onto the patio (while the owner was nowhere in sight), looking for scraps under the seated customers tables. For some, a dog taking food bits into its mouth then bringing it out for inspection and then licking it back off the ground might make for a perfectly acceptable dinner experience but it makes my stomach turn. And I realize that this might put me in the minority at least in the  Bown crossing area but being in the minority doesn\'t imply that my feelings/ expectations are wrong or to be ignored, does it? As a paying customer & a human being with a set of reasonable preferences, I have the right to a non-vomit-inducing dining experience on a restaurant patio. ""Dog friendly"" policy is one thing. ""We will have customers let their dogs run wild under your table as you eat"" is another. It is important to remember that the reason why civil society needed to devise so many rules is because, left upto their own devices, people don\'t always make considerate or even rational choices. Anyway, in sum, a very unpleasant experience.

I would call it 'Synthetically Colored rice'. I am guessing the color is some edible coloring thing they toss in along with the veggies and rice and oil. Well, how about some flavour, aye?  Here's a humble tip from someone who grew up eating briyani home made style, and has had authentic biryani in India: Please add some Ginger-garlic paste, and Green chillies, and may be , just may be, some garam masala.  The people of Boise who believe Biryani is what they serve, sure deserve more than mere red colored rice. No that is not Biryani! You are insulting the word Biryani! You are insulting the whole culture of Biryani making!  No. I am not going to die without attempting to tell you how grossly far away it is from anything like Biryani!  \n\nThe other dishes are alright actually. What they call Palak Paneer actually seems to have saag and palak in it, but tastes good anyways. What they call Dal tadka is simply dal makhani minus the cream. No that's not what it is supposed to be!   Stop giving wrong names to wrong dishes please. If you call it something it better be , well, just that.  \n\nTheir Samosas are awesome though.  They nailed it there. The buffets are good value for money. However, the wait list is usually long. But that shouldn't hurt their review. It, in fact, shows how much the people of Boise love what they serve here with names according to their own whims and fancies. Doesn't really matter as long as it tastes good I know! But when you know what it should be and you get a bowl of something else, is not so pleasantly surprising.  It is kind of annoying. Don't you think ?\n\nAnd the last time we visited them for a la carte dinner, the service was so bad. we waited a whole of 45 minutes for our rest of the meal to arrive after the appetizers. The appetizers 'appetized' us and left us gulping down water. When the dishes finally arrived, we simply got them boxed. Because we all were full- of water- tummy and bladders. We couldn't eat  and we all wanted to pee and did not want to use the wash room there.  \n\nYay to a so called good restaurant.

So many chutneys! Chutneys I've never seen or tried before - a cornucopia of chutneys! Mint chutney, tamarind chutney, mango chutney, hot chutney, coconut chutney! I judge an Indian restaurant by the quality of it's mint chutney and this one is bang-on! Spicy, salty, fresh and just thick enough to sit on top of my chicken without getting too watery everywhere.\n\nThere was a little spot for salad with a plain lettuce mix and separate toppings: red onion, cucumber, tomato, lemon wedges. Raita. Or you can do like me and just put mint chutney on everything!\n\nDesserts were mango something, rice pudding, gulab jamun. Classics.\n\nI'm telling you guys - this place had it all. I was blown away by the variety of foods (and  amount of people) they were able to squeeze into such a small space. And they never ran out of anything - all dishes were stocked.\n\nWhat to expect: for the lunch buffet when you walk in a waiter will direct you to an available seat.

The place was quiet for a Friday, and I had no trouble finding a seat at the bar. The staff was relaxed, uber-friendly and answered all my questions. I finally opted for a 4-beer sampler and a Beer & Bacon Burger, the latter being prepared by a food truck in the adjacent alleyway.\n\nThe beers in my sampler were all delicious and well-crafted: I was the least excited with the hazy IPA (it\'s a beer fad I\'m quickly getting burned-out on), but I loved the Scotch Ale, the 5-hop IPA and the English IPA.  When I discovered they had some of the English IPA on nitrogen, I decided to get a pint of that and stay a little longer. It was by far my best beer of the night. (I stopped by the following night to have another, but they were out of it...dang).\n\nAs for the food, my burger was absolutely phenomenal, cooked perfectly and with some kind of oniony bacon-jam. It came with excellent, thick-cut fries as well. A 5-star meal.\n\nCool feature: White Dog has a 5-inch wide, metal rail embedded in the bar that is held at icy temps so you can sit your beer on it, keeping it from getting too warm. I\'ve never seen this before, but it worked well (and it also made a fun, mini snowscape).\n\nIn short, I loved White Dog. It was a another, great Boise brewery ""find,"" and so I was surprised (and a little sad) the place was not busier. I understand they are still ""newish,"" and so hopefully they will gain a larger following over time.', ""Who doesn't love adorable pictures of dogs and wolves surrounding you while drinking delicious beer with great service?\n\nI came here one afternoon to enjoy a few pints while getting some work done. It was about 3:00 pm so I had the place to myself. It's a great space. Very open, ample seating, with HUGE skylights that let in so much beautiful sunshine. The bar top has this super cool ice run that you can put your beer on to keep frosty chilled. My old man is obsessed with ice cold beer, so I'm stoked to show him. \n\nI enjoyed the Blood Orange Hefeweizen and the Blackberry Sour. Both were delicious and hit the spot. I sat at a large booth and spread out all my things. The sun began to stream in through the skylights and I felt warm, content and happy. They happily gave me the public wifi password and I was checked on frequently. \n\nI did not sample their food, but the kitchen was hard at work and it smelled amazing. I will definitely be back to try it. \n\nThey do allow dogs, although pooches must remain outside on the patio. It was a very cool space and I look forward to sampling more!"", ""Cute brewery with a large selection of hazy beers. The Octoberfest is delicious! They have a good selection of snacks as well.

How about: I just threw up Wiseguy in the toilet. It\'s not really Wiseguy\'s fault. Well kind of. Who knows?! I guess you\'ll just have to read on to find out.\n\nThis week, Tom and I are joined by our friend Austin: mac n\' cheese connoisseur and pizza aficionado.\n\nDon\'t really know much about Wiseguy and couldn\'t find anything online. It\'s a NY style pizzeria. They have two sections; the front does pizza by the slice and the back is more of a sit down pizzeria with bar and sports. I really appreciate that you can have both experiences. Nice atmosphere. Very hipstery, parts of it look like a pirate ship and other parts look like a wine cellar or some kind of medieval hallway.\n\nTom and I each ordered a drink, a pepperoni slice, and a specialty slice. I got Hawaiian, he got veggie. Austin ordered a single slice of their signature Wise Guy which is essentially a meat-lover\'s. Two big slices and a drink came out to $7-something which is a very reasonable price.\n\nAs we waited for our slices to heat up, we watched Metallica proceeded to play the national anthem at a hockey game.\n\nMetallica on Ice: 1 shred out of 5\n\nAt some point we noticed our slices had not yet arrived which was a little strange. I jokingly said ""he probably forgot about our slices and the whole pizzeria will catch on fire."" As I say this, Tom sees the guy who put our slices in the oven walk nonchalantly into the room. Then he spots us, a look of alarm overtakes his face, and he runs back in the other direction. A few minutes later the guy walks back in and says, ""Hey so your slices... they\'re a little crispy. I\'m going to make another set but I forgot what you guys had."" We say it\'s no problem and tell him we had 2 peps, 1 veggie, 1 hawaiian, and a Wise Guy. A few minutes later he is back again with 2 veggies, 1 hawaiian, and a Wise Guy. We tell him that\'s not what we ordered and he\'s just devastated. The guy is so nice that we can\'t really be mad at him. We finally get the correct order and dig in.\n\n-Pepperoni-\nAustin says the dough tastes like marshmallows. Tom and I look at him confused. Don\'t believe Austin, the dough tastes like regular pizza dough. The pepperoni and meat-lovers in particular are very crunchy. I like crunchy but I know most folks would say this is too crunchy. You couldn\'t fold it without it cracking and falling apart. Sauce is good. It\'s very Italian but there\'s very little of it. That cheese though. The cheese is just awful. It didn\'t seem to bother the others as much but to me it was just goop. It\'s like when you have leftover pizza and heat it in the microwave for not enough time so it\'s kind of melted but not enough and it\'s really oily. The peps are \'flat on it\' style, not crunchy style. I\'m more of crunchy kind of guy but peps will be peps.\n\n-Veggie-\nThis is my favorite of the bunch and probably Austin\'s favorite as well. Tom doesn\'t like it much. The flavors are everything you expect from a veggie, strong taste of mushrooms, peppers, olives, and onions. That cheese though. AUGH.\n\n-Hawaiian-\nSome jalapenos for an extra kick, but really the jalapenos don\'t have any kick. Pineapple doesn\'t really have taste either. Canadian is very nicely cooked and tastes great. I would have preferred just the Canadian bacon.\n\n-Wise Guy-\nThis had some good meaty flavors. Mushroom and sausage go well together. Good steady flavor but no thrills. After the first bite, you kind of know what you\'re eating and you\'re just eating more of it. And that cheese. Oh that cheese. Cheese Louise amirite?\n\n-Verdict-\nSo when we left Tom and Austin were adamant that this place was really bad. I was more on the mediocre portion of the spectrum. Their argument was that it\'s downtown, there are at least a couple places that are better and just a few blocks away. My argument was that it was cheap and it wasn\'t that bad. I was ready to give this place 3 slices.\n\nThen the vomit.\n\nIt was hot, I had a headache, and pizza is not the best food to eat in these conditions. That being said, the pizza really didn\'t help. It was greasy and oily. I might have been more motivated to keep it in, had the pizza tasted better. I guess that doesn\'t make sense because if it tasted really good, then throwing up would kind of let me taste it a second time? So maybe if it tastes really good, then throwing up is actually a compliment?\n\nNah, it was bad. This actually brings up an important point about food that we didn\'t consider in the other reviews. You should feel good after eating it. This is the place you go to when Guido\'s and Pie Hole are closed for the day.\n\n1 slice out of 5\n\n[EDIT: Originally 2/5]', ""Can I get a slice of pepperoni and 2 health code violations for dine in?  Over an hour after I ate I was able to say good bye to some of the pizza's that greeted me when I came in. (they should have been thrown out after an hour per code ...Gross) \n\n  This is a hard order to fill in a lot of other places but here at Wise Guy's they gladly deliver.  In my quest to find the best NY pizza my travels took me to Guido's and next here, in my previous post NY Giant came out on top but how did Wise Guy's do?  Let's just say the atmosphere is way better than NY giant and Guido's combined, (sports bar meets brick bistro) \n\nFirst off BEST Coca Cola In the valley (carbon, water, syrup ratio is on point. Not that it matters) \n\n- Price Again same problem as Guido's the price is like we are in Manhattan not In Boise. \n\nSize- Again it fits on the plate (paper plate) 1/2 the size of authentic NY pizza.  \n\nFlavor-  I needed help so I consulted the 2 wise guys on painted on the wall, When I asked them how is my pizza bottom burnt yet the top looks barely cooked  they were just as lost for wisdom as I was. (Oh well) \nTo make matters worse the pizza was bland and the cheese was a hard congealed mess, it was not stretchy as melted cheese should be.  The sauce has some potential as I tasted it apart from everything else... so yay something good. \n\nOverall- \n My experience sitting in the big back room was that this place is run by a bunch of college guys, I watched one drink from his open container in the sight of all the customers. (against health code) \n  I spent over an hour dining here on purpose and making various phone calls.  Now many reviews state the pizza tasted old and flavorless, I was curious if I would witness old pizza being sold and I did.  Another cooking 101 pizza is 80 percent cooked, it then cooks the other 20% when you order.  80% cooked pizza sitting for more than an hour is breeding ground for bacteria and also strips cheese of the moisture giving it a non gooey texture.  \n\nNY Giant Still reigns as the best NY pizza in Boise \nGuido's tops wise guy by a landslide, but hey a digiorno beats this pizza. (Disclaimer) *All tasting was performed under a sober palette*"", ""This was our first time in as a family. My husband works downtown, and has been there before alone. I wanted a quick Guidos meal as it was late and the kids were starving. We had just been to a long yet fun city choir function at BSU. My husband suggested Wiseguy's, said I would like it. It was fast. Customer service was spot on. We sat in the back area, the kids got a table of their own. We loved the pizza, the garlic knots, and even the simple garden salad was fresh. The ranch dressing was cold, like it should be! I hate a warm dressing.. And ewe.. always scared to eat it anyway. \n\nThe downside.. Well, the NBA game was on and given there were only 3 other people there, one was LOUD. Now.. I'm no pansy to sports bar loudness. I get it! I love a good game. The couple at the bar were normal. Laugh a little, root a little. It's all good. But.. Apparently the LOUD girl was a girlfriend of someone working there. No food, maybe a drink by her, but good lord, I felt like I was sitting next to her. She cussed a few times, LOUDLY. Her ultra volume wasn't even about the game! Everything from her view about other girls to how she was the cutest baby in the world. I would guess she was pretty sober as well.. I'd HATE to see her inebriated.  Enter manager..or who appeared to be the manger. He was awesome. Told her to pipe down and then pointed to the kids in the room. I really appreciated that!\n\nWill I return? Yes. Do I hope girlfriend isn't there, just hanging out, legs stretched over a bar stool like a lounge chair in mega amp yelling mode? YES.""]",0.4,0.0,0.0,0.6,0.0,1.0,15.0

Walking in through the doors all changed in an instant. A nice calming noise suppression from the outside world happened when the doors closed behind us. Once inside, it was a down-home country cottage feel. The smile of the hostess was genuine & happy to see us. Background white noise was that of silverware klinking against stoneware & diners humming as they noshed. She showed us to the one open booth by the windows & introduced us to our server, Katie, who was already setting glasses of ice water down on our table. \n\nKatie smiled, and though her station looked busy, she made friendly small talk & gave us a moment to decide. When both our menus where on the table, she was there in an instant ready take our order. Unusual as I witnessed that she was hustling in her section. I\'m already impressed with her attentiveness. We ordered & she committed everything to memory.\n\nFor the wife: Bacon burger w/Tillamook Ched sat on a grilled Kaiser bun & came with bottomless fries! She likes her burgers ""medium"" & she had the ""Cheshire cat"" grin that signaled that it was cooked to perfection. We shared her fries as we knew we\'d get s\'more! They\'re good...but then I\'m reminded, ""...we ARE in IDAHO!""\n\nIt bein\' Saturday mid-morning & nursing the effects from a night out on the town, I went with the Saturday Market Skillet. A hefty meal of Hickory smoked ham, smoked bacon, German sausage, hash browns, red & green peppers, onions topped off with fluffy Tillamook Ched-scrambled eggs; served on a small cast-iron skillet. There on the side sat a fresh-baked buttermilk biscuit to die for. I love that my dish isn\'t overly seasoned as I like to add the salt n\' pep myself and the bacon/ham added just enough saltiness that didn\'t warrant any. But I like pepper. A pinch here, a pinch there, over the perfectly cooked eggs & the crispy outer bits of the hash, this dish was solid & guaranteed to knock last night\'s cobwebs outcha head!\n\nMy wife\'s fries were dwindling & somehow I locked eyes with Katie from a distance & she seemed to know what I was thinking as she mouthed the words ""...more fries?"" I couldn\'t help but grin & nod. Only in the Twilight Zone...\n\nKuddo\'s to the staff @ Elmer\'s for the awesome hospitality we\'d received while in BoDo.\n\nStepping back into the outside world, it was a return to the hustle, bustle & long faces. Night & day I tell\'ya.\n\nIt was 3.5-Star food, but a 5-Star experience throughout. The FREE Wi-Fi & Katie, being on point and easy on the eyes put it over the top.\n\nPlenty of parking on their private lot & a short walk from our hotel the Residence Inn Boise Downtown.', 'Definitely NOT the best first impression of Boise\'s dining scene. AT. ALL. \n\nElmer\'s was the first eatery I tried when I finally survived the 15 hour journey from Los Angeles, CA to the university.  The first ""real"" food since leaving SoCal at 3am.  And, the first time encountering a 9PM sunset.  The restaurant is located at the entrance of a hotel cul-de-sac, like Residence Inn and Townplace Marriott.  It\'s like any other American diner serving breakfast fare all day, sandwiches and burgers, and hot food plates with a mild touch of fancehh.  \n\nThere\'s an older woman running the show, she\'s very friendly, but she didn\'t talk much and a group of young\'uns serving the folks.  The servers are interesting, one of them, Justin looks like he could be a GQ model or something, not an apron wearing type guy.  Heck, he\'s not very good serving, he forgot straws three times (there were only 2 tables, us included).  Though, servers are friendly and very glad they kept a smile on their faces till the end.  \n\nThe place is rundown and old, it\'s outdated, dusty, sticky, and ughh.  The booths are the worst, your thigh skin/calf skin will stick to the seat and don\'t touch the window sill or anything by the booths, they don\'t wipe it down or remove the dead flies.  The carpet is like late 70s flower pattern and it\'s nasty, nasty enough I don\'t even want it to touch my shoes, heh.  The wall decorations are nice, they add that cozy factor along with their dustmiteous wall drapes. Other than whatever is going on in there, it\'s a pleasant restaurant with semi-decent edible food. \n\nMy group ordered: \n\nPot Roast w/ Broccolini and Mash Potatoes - SALTY. VERY SALTY. Mashed potatoes were wonderful, but the Pot Roast ruined it with so much salt. I felt like a cow licking a salt block. The broccolini was served as the ""seasonal vegetables,"" and I find this to be somewhat fancehh for a place like this, but nonetheless, it was fresh and tender.  \n\nHazelnut-Crusted Alaskan Cod w/ Pilaf and Broccolini - Probably the smallest portion of fish and pilaf I\'ve ever seen on a big empty plate. It was tasty enough though, and Granny somewhat enjoyed it so it\'s A-Okay.\n\nFarmer\'s Omelet w/ Hash Browns and Biscuit - Thee best value out of all. The omelet wasn\'t cooked very well, it\'s like they ran out of eggs so the omelet itself was mostly a flat egg tortilla, but it was loaded! The country gravy isn\'t my thing, so I just took it off.  Overall, this was a good choice and it lasted for 2 meals!! Oh, and ask for hash browns well done, it will taste better.\n\nChicken Fried Steak & Eggs - My brother is obsessed with Chicken Fried Steak and will order it just about anywhere. He said this was just ok, he said IHOP had better... I don\'t know what that says about Elmer\'s but, I think it\'s weird he compares it to IHOP LOL.  Anyway, funny story. The older woman came around to check on us and refill drinks, she tried to do the ""pour over someone\'s meal"" serving technique and it FAILED miserably.  The water pooled all over my bro\'s meal and on the table and his shorts. Yup. She came and got him a new, dry plate, but not a new meal... \n\nSaturday Market Skillet - My bf\'s dad ordered this and was slightly disappointed because it didn\'t come in a skillet.  The picture showed a cast iron skillet that would perhaps keep his food warm for awhile, it didn\'t happen. \n\nBreakfast Sandwich - typical sandwich. Bf enjoyed it, he took out the bacon because he thought there was too many slices (only 2 slices) LOL. Oh well, more for me! \n\nShort Stack - PANCAKES! JUST COME HERE FOR PANCAKES!! Pretty much the best edible thing here. Hot, fluffy, buttery pancakes with warm maple syrup. Made me happy for sure. GOOD JOB ON PANCAKES!! \n\nSo, our server Justin gives us the bill, we split the check, give him money, and only to find out that the bill didn\'t include the pancakes and he awkwardly hands us the new bill with the correct total. Really?! \n\nOverall, for semi-decent, semi-warm food, a solid 3.2 stars. Menu pictures look way better than in real life. Menu pictures also taste a bit better than in real life too, haha jk.  Not that wonderful but for the convenience (it\'s across from Boise U and by Residence Inn) it\'s ok.  No one got potty problems, so that was wonderful. Happy eating Boise!', ""Elmer's Restaurant is a long standing tradition in the northwest. They have been around for over fifty years and continue to feed both the residents of the northwest and hungry travelers much like myself. I guess that the restaurant started out in Portland, Oregon by Walt and Dorothy Elmer and was initially known for Walt's buttermilk pancakes and started franchising in 1966. Since I prefer a savory breakfast over a sweet breakfast, I opted for a Denver omelet with Tillamook cheddar cheese. As I have said, I am not too into sweet breakfasts, but my client had a German pancake and it looked pretty impressive. I had never even heard of a German pancake,much less seen one. It looked good.\n\nMy Denver omelet was good and a great way to start the day.  \n\nElmer's uses a lot of products from the northwest, so you do get a true taste of the northwest.\n\nI would definitely recommend this establishment for a breakfast spot.

I tend to favor porters and stouts and so my favorite beer was their Varangian Nectar Stout, which was smooth without sacrificing complexity. I also really enjoyed another stout (don't remember the name!) that had a marvelous smoky flavor (not for everyone, but I rather enjoyed it). Their nut brown was quite good and rivals any brown ale out there. Their Freya's Pale From Exertion is  an incredibly smooth and easy drinking beer, for those who fancy pales without a ton of hoppiness. \n\nThe service was above and beyond wonderful. They have bar billiards, which we had never played before and a guy working in the tap room (brewer? owner? bartender? not sure) came over and gave us a run down of how to play (even though the rules are posted), which I thought was terribly kind. They also have a couple brewery dogs (kept mostly out of the tap room), which I always love to see. And, because they don't serve food, dogs are allowed inside! Love dog friendly breweries!\n\nThe best part? They're located across the street from Costco.

Selection is not as robust as it was at the old site but Marcus is working hard to get it there as customers discover he is here.\n\nThe name remains the same for Reel Foods as before although the ""& Oyster Bar"" piece is not so much evident.  And there is no hot food or prepared take out being done here as was so at the other location, simply because there is no kitchen at which to do it on this site.\n\nBut Marcus is not only enthusiastic and skilled buyer of all things seafood, he is also a Chef and he is hoping once he settles in at this location and gets his processes and fish inventory where he wants them to be that he\'ll be able to find an additional location offering hot food.  During our brief time in the new store, at least three other shoppers came in asking about hot dishes that were served at the other store.  Marcus says that is a common request so he hopes to find a space to provide what customers want. \n\nAs has always been so for the fish Marcus sells, he can tell you where it came from and when it came in.  He ""walks the talk"" of transparency in sourcing.  He is still getting processes and stocks into the mode of new normal for this location, but on the day of our Monday holiday - when he was open visit - he had things like fresh halibut, Dungeness crab, sashimi grade tuna, Ecuadorian wild shrimp harvested that were large - 12 ct/lb size, rockfish, Atlantic salmon, steelhead and petrale.\n\nOpen six days a week (closed Sunday) with fresh deliveries daily, Marcus shared that his busiest days are Friday and Saturday and that is when he has the most fresh fish delivered.\n\nHe is keeping a low profile for marketing for now until he gets completely rooted in here.  But we\'re glad he\'s back and pass along the news to others.  I\'ve requested Yelp change the ""closed"" header.\n\nPARKING:  Private lot.\n\nACCESSIBILITY:  Level in the and all on one floor with ample floor space.  Marked accessible parking at the far end of the mall lot has no curb ramp associated but there is a ramp still further down. (Those aren\'t Reel Foods\' failures but the Vista Village strip mall owner\'s problem of non ADA compliance even 29 years into the law.)  \n\nGOOD NEIGHBORS:  Long time family owned Lee\'s Candies is near the other end of this same strip mall.  A good place to pick up some sweet treats.', 'It does not get better than this for the very freshest seafood with a broad variety of options.  That the owner, Marcus Bonilla, is such a nice guy and that the folks that work there are delightful too makes it all the better for shopping experience.  See my earlier review for details, but it is just great to see shoppers who care about knowing what their seafood is and where it comes from have found Reel Foods now that Marcus has settled in to the new location.  (See my earlier review for the details.)  Marcus and his team can answer any question about sourcing and arrival date and even preparation. \n\nI also appreciate that Marcus follows safe shopping protocols during this covid19 time and it seems all we who like to shop there do too.  Everyone in mask, lined up with 6 feet (or more) between us, only 3 shoppers at a time inside the store.  And on one occasion earlier on in the ""stay home"" period I ordered in advance and one of Marcus\' team happily delivered my order to the cooler inside the open SUV hatch when I called from the parking lot.  (Side note re cooler:  We always arrive prepared with cooler and ice packs inside for transporting fish home.  But just in case you don\'t the folks at Reel always ask if you\'d like a pack of ice to use to travel home with your \'catch\' and provide it for customers who want it.)\n\nI think Reel now does some scheduled delivery too.

I live about 30 minutes drive away (in normal traffic times) and may try delivery some time.\n\nIn the meantime, I follow Marcus\' posting of what fish is available (see his FB page or link to same on his web site http://reelfoodsfish.com/ ) and make the trek every other week to buy a couple of day\'s worth of the freshest seafood to savor at home.  We have enjoyed great Dungeness crab (they\'ll clean it for you), halibut, rockfish, cod, swordfish, dry (day boat) scallops and Marcus\' in house made lobster salad on rolls baked for him by local bakery Gaston\'s.  And while we don\'t choose sushi as an option, if you\'re a sushi eater I\'ll point out he has a wealth of sushi grade fish of all kinds in the case which always seem to be big sellers for other customers when we shop in store.', ""Good news worth sharing for customers and fans of Reel Foods, like me, who wonder where it is going now that a 'closed and moving' sign has been up for several weeks at the Capital Boulevard location.  Per article in The Statesman this morning:\n\n*Owner Marcus Bonilla hopes for mid-March 'ish' opening of the shop at the relocation address 1118 Vista Avenue (Vista Village Shopping Center in the Bench Depot area).\n\n*They are remodeling the space that was once a Blimpie's sandwich shop.  Smaller space by far than the old digs.\n\n*The focus will be entirely on being the neighborhood fishmonger. \n\n*There will no longer be the restaurant food that was available at the old location in the small dining space at the back.  Farewell to the fantabulous Oyster Po'Boys and the sushi rolls to say nothing of that luscious-lobstah salad for rolls when they had it.  Although they may add in chowder and seafood stew for take away once the new market is up and running.\n\n*Hours likely to be Mon-Fri 10-6 and Sat 9 - 6 / Closed Sun.\n\nI am disappointed in losing the convenient parking at the Capitol Boulevard location with the lot adjacent and easy and quick in and out to Reel Foods but pleased to learn they are going to refocus their original charter of being fishmonger (as they were when Ocean Foods owned it into 2015) and not restaurant.  The casual dining eats were good for sure, but the last couple of times I was in the shop I wondered if the owner needed to revisit mission.  It seemed the restaurant piece of Reel might be sapping the focus of the fishmonger primary function.  I walked out empty handed on both of last two visits given such limited options in the fresh case and the staff at counter told me it was several days old when I asked when one of the few fin fish choices was delivered. \n\nI'm looking forward to having the great fishmonger piece of Reel Foods back!

I also liked that they weren't being over done on safety protocols but they were reminding customers of the rules when they weren't following them like walking through the restaurant without a mask or please wear it upon entering.  Plus they did a great job of social distancing the tables as well. So for applause for following what we should be doing...\n\nThe sandwich and soup was outstanding and yet not a lot of ingredients....I had the Do Gouda sandwich and consisted of roast beef, gouda, onion marmalade on sourdough bread with some fresh greens. Also accompanied was a cup of their tomato soup.  First bite of the sandwich I was like Oh Yeah! The crispness of the sourdough and then the blend of cheese, meat and onion marmalade was in every bite. Then onto the soup and well balanced here with very forward tomato which in my opinion is the best because some folks think they need to reinvent this classic and they don't.  So after a few bits of my sandwich and sips of soup something dawned on me and that was just because this wasn't grilled cheese (which they have by the way) this sandwich would taste amazing dipped in this soup. Well here I went and wow a whole new flavor profile immersed. So while I wasn't planning on dipping this sandwich into my soup that's exactly how I finished. \n\n\nSomething else that threw this into 5 star for me is how friendly and nice the staff was about everything.

Check!\n\nThey have a variety of sandwiches with familiar names, but their interpretation never fails to improve upon a good thing. Their Sloppy Joe? Includes slow simmered chorizo. I also love that their French Dip-like sandwich (theirs is a ""Pot Roast Dip"") is made with turkey pot roast! I love French Dip, but much prefer turkey to beef--so this sandwich is a great (and delicious) option for me. \n\nGreat service? Check!\n\nI\'ve never failed to receive attentive service here. From my first visit to my most recent--I have always been met with supreme friendliness.\n\nGreat atmosphere? Check!\n\nWith quirky, fun, and creative decor in a prime downtown locale--what\'s not to love?\n\nAnd, finally, the pièce de résistance? \n\nFor every sandwich you purchase, the funds for one is donated to local nonprofits to feed the hungry. \n\nTheir charitable business model alone would make me a fan.\n\nThankfully, for local taste buds, they\'ve got a whole lot more going for them than that.\n\nOh!

Some unagi that was good!! I have been so dissapointed in Boise sushi selection, especially the unagi. But this place gave me hope. It was delicious, so we're the valcano roll and squid salad. Husband had hibachi and he even had left overs. Food was delicious, portions we're large and price was right. Definitely going back soon to try other dishes"", 'I came here for ramen.  I\'m not going to sit here and say that because I used to live in San Diego or that I\'m this-or-that makes me an expert on what ramen should be.  To me, it\'s like any other food. If it tastes good and you like it, that\'s what it should be. With that being said, I enjoyed the ramen here so much I\'ve been back several more times. Does this place have ""authentic"" ramen?  Who cares. It was good. \n\nNow that I\'m off my soapbox, I will say my favorite has been the Kimchi ramen with spicy broth. The tonkotsu ramen is good, too, but I think there\'s more flavor in the spicy broth.  Again, it\'s subjective. I\'ve had the chashu ramen, as well, but I\'m not a fan of fatty pork unless the broth is blazing hot making the pork almost creamy. Requisite veggies as well as the standard boiled egg in the ramen. \n\nAs their name implies, there is a sushi bar in the back. I\'m not a huge sushi fan, but my mom ordered some and said it was good.  I think I\'ve seen more plates of sushi on the tables than bowls of ramen when I\'ve been in. I assume that\'s a good sign for the sushi. Potstickers were pretty good, too. \n\nThis place gets busy. They\'ve only got a couple options for parties with 5 or more and we\'ve had to wait for one of the larger tables to free up. Otherwise the service has always been good and friendly and the prices are reasonable.  Give it a shot.', 'Oh man, I REALLY hate to do reviews of ramen places because I\'ve been to a few of the top-rated ramen places in North America. This ruins you for all the other ramen out there because you now know EXACTLY what perfect ramen is like, so please beat that in mind as you read. I\'ll also preface this by saying we ordered for pickup, so the dine-in experience may differ significantly.\n\nWe ordered ramen, they have a really weird way of classifying their ramen, unlike anything I\'ve ever seen. It made me ask if they were even serious about ramen until I poked around a little more. You start by choosing your protien...or veggie only option, then you choose the broth. Tonkatsu, miso, or...darn, now I don\'t recall the third option, maybe kimchi (not a fan)? There is no option for extra this or that like I\'ve seen so many other places. We both had tonkatsu with pork.\n\nSushi is a little more straightforward and I ordered an appetizer with 5 pieces of sushi. I\'m a sashimi guy myself, but first time I thought it prudent to go the safe route. Not bad, not exceptional, but nothing to complain about either, so fine. It came with everything you\'d expect, a generous lump of wasabi :), pickled ginger and the obligatory little cup of soy sauce. No complaints on flavor or texture, it all seemed fresh.\n\nThe ramen...I liked the egg, well done with a nice softish center and good flavor, the pork was also good. The noodles, they were a little stiff at the beginning and needed to soak and a little prodding from the chopsticks in the broth for several minutes before they gave up on their plan to remain one giant lump. My wife even asked, ""What\'s wrong with the noodles?"" On the plus side, it did seem like a larger serving of ramen that I\'ve seen elsewhere.\n\nSpecial note for the monosodium glutamate sensitive like me, I\'ve had ramen that gave me an upset stomach within an hour of enjoying it, the ramen here DID NOT upset my stomach.\n\nI just moved to Boise from Phoenix so hey, all things are relative and maybe, just maybe, this is the best ramen in Boise. I learned to enjoy what I had in AZ, even if it did bother my stomach 100% of the time. What I do know is that I enjoyed this ramen much more than the stuff I had downtown last year. Maybe, just maybe the ramen is ""knock your socks off"" awesomeness when you enjoy it at the restaurant...which I didn\'t do.\n\nFinal verdict, the quality of both sushi and ramen was good enough that I will try it again...in the restaurant, they deserve that much. I would order sushi/sashimi to go without hesitation. Getting a look at the shrimp tempura while I sat inside waiting really made me curious about the rest of the menu too!']",0.2,0.0,0.0,0.8,0.0,1.0,30.0

We parked on 13th street and walked up and down the two sides looking at all of the places to eat before making our decision. We didn't intend to eat here, we just knew that we wanted something downtown but not the hustle and bustle of the city center, so we decided on Boise's north end. In the Northend, you'll find old-style residential homes and a block of fun places to eat and drink, a nostalgic candy shop, a toy store and much more. \n\nThe restaurant has a modern look, which drew us to it. We crossed the street and into the Pizza place we go. This place is much more than pizza! They had many televisions playing football and pleanty of seating. There is a large bar in the middle. Seat yourself and the menus are already on the table so you don't have to wait. Our server brought us water, with no ice, and asked us if we wanted anything else to drink. We did get ice when we got a refill. \n\nWe ordered-- the menu has appetizers (photo attached), sandwiches, pizza, and a few more items, but not a whole lot more. Looking at other tables the pizza appears to be a hit. \nI ordered the turkey meatball appetizer.Three very large meatballs in a well-balanced marinara sauce topped with a (small) piece of mozzarella cheese. The meatballs were very flavorful and spiced with herbs and had a good flavor. I only ate one and took the other home where they were just as good the next day. My only complaint is that I would have liked more cheese. \n\nMy dining companion got the meatball sub with chips. He was a fan of the sub but not the chips. They tasted hard to him and they made his teeth feel as if they were going to break because they were hard. I didn't try them, so I will take his word on it. The meatballs, also turkey, were just as good as the large meatball appetizer only smaller in size. \n\nThe prices were fair as the meal for two was under $20. Friendly people."", 'The pizza here is clutch. When friends and family are in town and they are craving pizza, I have brought them here. This is definitely on the higher price point for pizza but you get what you pay for and the ingredients are of quality, especially that goat cheese. \n\nThe Certified, Hyde House, Hyde and Seek, Goodies, and Sun Ray have been some of the best pizza I have had in years. Ask for some hot sauce or ranch and you will be golden! (Get a salad if you want to be healthier. The Cobb and the House were delicious but pizza is always better.)\n\nThey are large tables for many or the bar for the solos (often me.) Service is not bad but at times we have had to wait longer than normal with empty water glasses, the check, or to-go boxes. With that said, I notice that usually one person is running the floor so I am more patient knowing that pour soul working the floor is busy as a bee.\n\nPlan to wait to eat here if you pick the meal hours. Coming here outside of the normal dinner hour (a bit earlier than 6/7 or a bit after 8, your wait will be much shorter if any.\n\nThey also have my favorite beer on tap, a hef.', ""Just opened, so we decided to try it out. \nPrices are pretty high, very slow service. Over 45 min wait for pizza and a sandwich, place wasn't busy. That's much too long for lunch service.\n\nPizza was good. \n\nSalad was undressed, but then they charged for more dressing.

I surely do love me a big soft cookie and that is exactly what I got when I ordered from here. My journey with this cookie started when I seen one if my friends post these cookies on their Instagram and I instantly did some Instagram investigation to figure out where she got them from. Once I found out it was Crumbl, I then looked on their Instagram page and seen all the goodness they were offering. The pictures looked so good that I wanted to eat my phone (luckily I didn't). \n\nSo, I proceeded to go to their website, which is a very clean website and order a bunch of cookies. They also have an app that is very easy to order from. Once you go to order off the website they have a bunch of preset cookie boxes that you can order. for instance, you can order up to 1 to 6 cookies at a time with the main flavors being chocolate chip, a specialty flavor and snicker doodle. I opted to go with the option of ordering a preset box of three chocolate chip and three of their specialty cookies. They have different specialty cookies every week and this week was the butterfinger cookie. I ordered on Thursday and the cookies got to me on Tuesday. They were still very fresh and once I warmed them up a bit they tasted sooooo good. They are actually big enough to where you can cut it in fours and share it with people. This is what I did so my family and I could taste the different flavors. My son really enjoyed the chocolate chip. The price point is good. Paid $27 for six huge cookies and shipping. \n\nMy only gripe with this place is that when placing my order I noticed my order shipped from Boise and not a closer store which would be in North Carolina. I feel like if my order would have came from here I would have gotten my cookies a lot faster and they would have maybe been fresher to.

Us. My wife & I. \nOn my birthday no less. \nUnspectacular. Unbelievable. Unequivocally the epic fail of our stay in Boise.\n\n.\n\nAlthough we were seated quickly (it wasn\'t very busy - maybe less than half the dining capacity), it took over 10 minutes before I had to...nay, before I NEEDED to wave a waitress over. If I have to wave a staff member over to the table you\'ve already put your review in jeopardy. That type of wait time is uncalled for. With attitude, she asked what she could get for us. ""uh...how about a couple glasses of water, some bread & maybe take our drink order, bitch?!"" ...but I asked nicely just in case the night & her attitude gets better. I\'m a believer of ""benefit of the doubt"" mantra & will give anyone a chance & she was no different. \n\nMy wife excuses herself from the table saying she needs to visit the ladies\' room. (I found out later that she stopped to talk to the manager mentioning that it was my birthday and if they could bring a lil something over for dessert.)\n\nWith lead feet our waitress sludges from the bar with our drink orders, and before she leaves again, we ask if she\'d take our dinner order. Oh, she had a \'tude alright...\n\nIt\'s been 20 minutes since we placed the order, our glasses are empty & she\'s nowhere in sight..WTF? It\'s been 45 minutes since we\'ve sat down! For the next 5 minutes I\'m scanning the dining room & just as I was about to get up out of my chair, I see her...with plates in hand...coming to our table! Yay. Finally. With anticipation, my succulent bacon-wrapped tenderloin is about to remind me of how much I love Bardenay\'s. \n\nWhoa nelly! My medium ordered steak was a little more on the ""well"" side. Overcooked & dry...I wasn\'t going to complain, so I took it in stride & tried to stomach a couple more bites. The garlic mashed seemed less fluffy & stiffer than I remembered (like the whole plate sat under warming lamps longer than it needed to). I\'m a little pissed, but I didn\'t wanna get overly excited as my wife wanted a lovely evening with her husband on his birthday. She seemed to enjoy her meal just fine, but she\'s good w/McD\'s fries & a few packets of ketchup...I\'m seeing red & can\'t even remember what she ordered, nor do I remember what kind of veggies accompanied my steak.\n\nPlates are cleared; a bit of after dinner convo & our waitress comes over with a piece of cake on a saucer & says ""uh...is this for you?"" to my wife. Wifey says, ""no..."" and does that eye thing to say ""...it\'s for him. It\'s HIS birthday cake"" look. So, after hearing my wife say ""no"", and taking no hint from the eye gesture, she retreats back to wherever she crawled from with cake in hand. My wife and I just kinda look at each other, dumbfounded. I say, ""don\'t worry about it, let\'s just pay the bill, get out of here & meet up with your friends at 10th Street Station. We\'ll have a great time!""\n\nMy wife is looking at the bill & her expression goes from a smile that says she\'s enjoying my company to pure annoyance. She storms out of her chair & makes a b-line for the waitress. I dunno what\'s going on, but I\'m intrigued. I can\'t hear what\'s going on but the expressions of my wife towards that waitress was fun to watch.\n\nMy wife returned to the table w/out the bill. She proceeded to tell me that ""ugh, that waitress! OH, HELL NO! She added that piece of cake to the bill!"" I had to laugh. Not because it was funny, but because I had nothing to say in response to how bad this waitress was. The waitress placed the check on the table, without a word. No ""my apologies"", no nuthin\'. The wifey scanned over the check to make sure all is right in the world, paid with cash & we left. When we reached the sidewalk, wifey says, ""Bitch is lucky she got a 10% tip!""\n\nBardenay\'s...you\'ve left us with a bad taste in our mouths. Please hire experienced servers OR give your wait staff the proper training your establishment deserves. Hiring gum-smacking bleach-blonde high school dropouts with condescending attitudes does not represent well.

Without hesitation they got their crew to put several tables together & within minutes our drink orders were taken.\nOur server didn\'t even flinch when I asked if I could sample two of their IPAs (without charge I might add). Before taking our food order he offered to split the check however we wanted! What server would even consider to ""offer"" that? This guy did...he already had me at the IPA samplers.\nWhile waiting for the food to arrive, I always imagined that if I ever owned a bar/grill, I\'d definitely like to model ""my"" bar after Bardenay\'s. In no way is it original as it borrows its style from many shot-gun bars I\'ve seen in my bar hopping travels. It is certainly done with class.\nThey have a great selection of draught beers & next to that resides a refrigerated glass window wine bottle dispensary with several great selections. Above center a large mirror is cantered so that you can ""see"" pretty much everything from wherever you are seated. I also noted the showcase of which sat the distiller. It\'s magnificent! Like a piece of art on display. Barneday has a daily/weekly liquor special in which they personally have distilled. This day it was gin. I\'d have liked to have tried it, but tonight, I\'m into the IPAs. I like the use of the used brick which covers most of the interior walls & the high beam ceilings. Not that the high beam ceilings are original either...just that it looked so clean up there & not packed with an inch of dust as I\'ve seen many other joints, pubs & restaurants with this common problem...\nThree wait staff, including our server arrived serving up our party\'s dishes.

This location is downtown in the Basque quarter, so you just know it's gonna be tons of fun and totally delicious! \nThe food is crazy good. We were with a good size group of people and we all got something different and passed our dishes around. We started with the Smoked Trout appetizer, it was so good that it actually reminded me of my grandma's smoked salmon spread... it's as good as grandmas!!\nWe all decided to order the Mediterranean dish which included some delicious hummus, baba ganoush and some warm pita triangles. I'm a total sucker for these flavors and this fresh, simple appetizer is executed at the highest level. \nI had a Cider Brined Pork Chop and it was really good... I've had better (I prefer double chops to keep it more juicy) but it was a solid dish. \nMy wife ordered the Fish and Chips and they were incredible! So crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked inside. My son ordered the cheese burger and he didn't give me a bite.. he said it was almost as good as what I make. \n\nThe decor is pretty simple but being close to Halloween they did have some great decorations up. \n\nThis place is good size and they have a ton of seating but they filled up pretty quickly. I'm not sure if they take reservations but you might call ahead. \n\nAll in all we loved this meal and are looking forward to going back!!""]",0.625,0.0,0.0,0.375,0.0,1.0,30.0

Recently removed as part of a front spruce up, it is worth memorializing the phrasing here since since it seemed just right..\n\nWhile we\'re on phrasing, to riff on the old Amex slogan...\n\n...MEMBERSHIP HAS ITS\' BENEFITS:\n\nYou don\'t need to be a Co Op member to shop here but, really, if you Co Op shop just once a month why wouldn\'t you?  It costs only $65 to join, a one time fee with no annual dues.  But if you join on the first Friday of any month you get a $15 discount and membership is only $50.  Why one would join other than a first Friday, I know not.\n\nMembers are entitled to periodic specials.  Better yet, once a month on any day of your choice you can receive a 10% discount on your entire order.  You will very quickly recover that $50 membership fee!\n\nOn that same day of the month you also will receive a 10% discount from any purchases at the Co Op Wine Shop or the Co Op Pet Shop just  across the parking lot.  The 10% off the Wine Shop discount one day a month sure comes in handy for my hubby and me.\n\nEven if those other two shops don\'t beckon to you, there are...\n\n...SO MANY THINGS TO LIKE HERE:\n\nPEOPLE:  Friendly staff, including the young woman checker who went out of her way when it was evident I was a stranger in a new land on my first few visits to talk to me each time, make you feel welcome.\n\nPREPARED FOODS & DELI:  They list local purveyors used in their dishes, all of which are made in house.  (Try that at Whole Foods...you won\'t find it.)  This is the only market where I trust the take away and enjoy it.  PS to my omnivore, vegan, vegetarian and paleo friends, there are an equal number of great options for all.\n\nCHEESE:  A very good selection of domestic and imported and a super helpful woman, who also once lived in my former home city, works there who always has a wonderful tip or two. .\n\nPRODUCE:  Leans almost all organic, has local vendors (like Purple Sage and Peaceful Belly) and carries things no one else does, like the fresh Emmett grown strawberries that went into October this year.  Their seasonal offerings can\'t be beat.  This week they had two kinds of fresh kumquats, most groceries carry none at all, and beautiful escarole.  \n\nBAKERY:  Local breads, like Gaston\'s wonderful Pouichette and Acme\'s teriffic breads of all kinds are sold here.  Their in house bakery has the most mmmmmarvelous ginger cookies and lots of other good things.   They have Wildflower Bakery  treats, like baked apple cider donuts or blueberry pound cake on a display.  They also have Boise\'s  own Guru donuts.\n\nPACKAGED FOODS:  In addition to staples, like canned tomatoes, in brands we use, the Co Op always seems to have what I\'m looking for that is hard to  find elsewhere.  Pomegranate molasses, for example..  They also have a great selection of top end, Italian made, speciality shape pastas.  My husband is a very happy guy that they have Willamette Valley Fruit Growers frozen berries in the freezer section in 2 pound bags.  \n\nDAIRY: The dairy section is a bit small, but they have yogurt and buttermilk which does it for me.\n\nMEATS $ FISH: The meat section is also a bit small, but what they do have is organic and humanely raised and the butchers there know their stufff.  The fish selection is even smaller and we normally find ourselves at Reel to buy ours.\n\nTUNES:  Music on the sound system is so great it makes me want to sing and dance as I shop.\n\nINSIDE SEAT TO EAT: There is a nice area inside where you can sit to nosh.   Seating is both at high counters and  standard tables so accessible to everyone.  \n\nTHIS N THAT:\n\n1) PARKING:  Can be bumper cars even though the lot is good sized.  Proceed with caution.\n\n2) ACCESSIBILITY:  From accessible parking in the door and throughout ample aisles, all is good.\n\n3) NEIGHBORS:  The Co Op Wine Shop is unarguably the finest in Boise.  It may even be the best wine seller we\'ve ever had the fun of shopping at and it is just across the parking lot.  See those reviews too.  Richard\'s Cafe Vincino two doors down from the Wine Shop is a wonderful place for lunch or dinner.  \n\n4) MERIDIAN ON THE HORIZON:  Co Op is opening a second location in Meridian.  Will be closer to home for me.  Wohoo!  Their goal is summer 2015.', 'The Boise CoOp provides the most disgraceful customer service I have ever seen at any food market anywhere. \n\nAfter searching the dairy area for cottage cheese I was unable to locate it. I asked an employee standing 10 feet away. Rather than step down from his ladder and walk me to the product--as is done in every grocery store in the country--I was directed to the deli area. When I couldn\'t find it there the deli employees directed me back to the dairy area. I then approached the original employee who did in fact step down and walk me to the item in the dairy area. \n\nOn five separate occasions I have  requested information about a roasted turkey product sold behind the deli counter. I\'ve asked three deli employees and two customer service counter folks where it comes from, is it organic, and why they don\'t slice it for sandwiches. Answers have varied from, ""The turkey arrives roasted and chopped,"" to ""We are only allowed to slice Boar\'s Head products on our slicer,"" to ""You have to ask the deli manager."" Oh really, who is that? None of these employees was interested in attaining the information for themselves so that they might better assist the next customer. Letters to management go unanswered. \n\nLooking for local organic products? Better go to the Saturday Capital Market rather than the CoOp. Although the packaging may be pretty very few items come from local farms. Expect to find produce from around the world. Looking for healthy packaged food? Products on these shelves may contain GMOs, BHT, BPE, and BGH. Read labels carefully. \n\nThe local Winco has identical products for roughly 60% of the price, and employees who actually know the store and are willing to help. \n\nBoise CoOp, shape up! Although the latest Whole Foods plan was denied by city council, they will be here soon. Their employees are well trained and their products are guaranteed to be free of many of the carcinogens you sell in fancy packaging.\n\n**12/28/10 edit**\nI bought medicinal herbs here the other day. Without getting into specifics let me warn you that the herbs were mislabeled. When I got home I realized the mistake and threw away the mislabeled herb. This could have been a very dangerous situation. Medicinal herbs--used improperly--can cause a multitude of problems on their own, or in combination with other medicines.\n\nI brought the problem to the attention of employees, who corrected it but did not seem concerned.', 'Boise Co-Op fill in the blank review...\n\nPlease select the most relevant response which completes the following sentence:\n\nThe Boise Co-Op ________ than Whole Foods.\n\n1) is more EXPENSIVE  \n2) offers less VARIETY\n3) is less FRESH  \n4)  is DiIRTIER\n5) ALL the ABOVE']",0.0,0.2,0.2,0.6,0.0,1.0,30.0

I would usually avoid this much chaos but they're one of the only coffee places open late that serve an excellent latte.\n\nAlmond milk latte on a green couch\nMy favorite seat in the house to sip a latte is the green couch, it's got personality.

Charming outdoor dining space, great service, tucked away in the North End, and the yummiest food!\n\nATMOSPHERE: Okay, I am totally a sucker for atmosphere, so the dining space alone had me sold on this place. I actually didn't set foot on the inside part of their restaurant. I sat outside at a cute little table on the patio and enjoyed the sunshine, stringed lights, covered patio, misters, simple landscaping (mostly succulents), and a perfect view of all that's happening on 13th street--just dreamy.\n\nFOOD: \n\nWe tried the ahi wontons for our appetizer. Now before I start explaining how phenomenal these were, I must put out a disclaimer: I don't like raw fish. Now that we've got that out of the way, I will say that this dish had me strongly reconsidering that statement. These wontons were SO good, I would have ordered just a plate of those for dinner had I known how much I'd enjoy them. Seared ahi sitting on top of a crisp wonton with a wasabi cream, and cucumber. The perfect combination of textures--the ahi was easy to sink my teeth into, cucumber crisp, and wonton at the bottom tied it all together with a nice crunch. The wasabi sauce gave it the right amount of kick. SO yummy. \n\nFor dinner, I had their veggie special of the night, which was a burrata cheese salad with fried potato wedges on the side. I loved this also, but man oh man, can I have some more of those wontons?! Those were my favorite part. \n\nTo finish off our meal, my friend and I split their ice cream sandwich. It was simple and sweet, just like it should be--two homemade cookies divided by a generous dollop of vanilla ice cream.  \n\nAnd of course, the drinks! We split a 22 oz bottle of Meriwether Cider's Ginger Cider. This was refreshing and paired perfectly with enjoying a meal outside on a hot summer day!\n\nSERVICE: Our server was friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and attentive. Every question we had about the menu, he had an answer to, our waters were full the whole time, and he was accommodating to our requests.\n\nI cannot wait to come back...and when I do, you better believe it'll be Amie-Eats-Ahi-Wontons 2.0."", ""We came here for dinner on Friday night.

Twisted Timber checked all my boxes for an A+ evening. If I could more than 5 stars, I would. \n\nFor drinks my husband tried a Lush IPA (7% ABU, 80 IBU, Fremont Brewing) and I downed 2 glasses of Bourbon Barrel Peach Cider (6.9% ABV, Tieton Cider Works). It was the perfect balance of tart from the apples and sweetness from peaches. Super crisp and refreshing. I could have drank more if I wasn\'t DD. \n\nFor food, we split a Buffalo Pizza with Cauliflower Crust (10"", Buffalo sauce, chicken, olive, spinach, and avocado,  $16.00) and baked sweet potato fries ($5.95). Okay, if I\'m being completely honest here I have to say I have my suspicions about the cauliflower crust because it was just too damn good! I\'ve had cauliflower crust that was absolutely horrendous but you know what you\'re getting yourself into. The avocados were a nice touch and these were fresh! No browning or bruises on any pieces. It honestly was a really pretty piece of food. The sweet potato paired excellently. They were cooked to crispy perfection and served with delicious fry sauce. I\'ll come back just for some cider and fries!\n\nWe both walked out more than satisfied and agreed this is somewhere we may very well began to frequent on the regular. I definitely recommend Twister Timber to everyone!', ""There are some places I've been visiting for so long that I just forget to Yelp about them. When I saw another Yelper's post about the Timber, as we lovingly refer to it, I checked to reread mine only to find out it doesn't exist, so here goes:\n\nThe Timber rocks. It's like a neighborhood spot. When we lived near Maple Grove and Lake Hazel, it was just a hop, skip and a jump away, so we were the regulars and got to know some of the servers by name. To this day, it still tickles me when we come in (after months of absence) and are recognized by their friendly wait staff. Great, great people work here and share their love, knowledge and passion for beer with their guests. I should mention, or maybe I shouldn't, that they never turn me down when I ask for excessive tastes. I'm sorry, but I love variety and I love trying new beers. So I always know that I will wind up with something I like, instead of being forced into picking a beer that I'm uncertain about.\n\nTheir tap selection is seriously killer. I love Bier:Thirty and a couple of other tap-houses in the area, but find most of them to be kind of stout / porter / black IPA heavy (even in the summer, when you couldn't pay me to drink something dark). Maybe one of the reasons I love the Timber so much is because they cater to my tastes a little more, which means more pale ales, IPAs, blondes and lagers / pilseners. However, they certainly have maltier, darker things available (just not in the abundance that other places might; sorry, Ophelia!), such as Mack and Jack's African Amber (it's almost always there) and a rotating stout / porter. Whoever selects their beer has amazing taste, usually featuring something out-of-this world (think Rogue's Dead Guy [even Double Dead Guy, on one occasion], Stone's Arrogant Bastard, Odell's Myrcenary, etc.). They also have amazing tap takovers by my favorite brewers in the world, such as Lagunitas, Deschutes and Hop Valley (my latest obsession).\n\nI think if one area could improve, it could be the food; however, I haven't tried enough to really comment on this. Their baked, seasoned fries are incredible and we almost always order them. Their Timber sandwich (corned beef, turkey, bacon, the fixin's) is great, but their spicy ham sandwich and Rueben are a little lacking. Their house salad, as well as the mixed greens that come as a side with sandwiches, are really great and better than you would expect for a place like this. I think their pizza is just okay. I've heard great things about their nachos from multiple parties, but have never tried them myself. You could seriously do worse in the food department, it just doesn't satisfy as well as some other places. However, the tap selection is enough to bring my back every time (and make the drive now that we live further North).\n\nThe ambiance is, as another Yelper described, somewhere between a cozy sports bar (there are a few screens; free shuffle board; darts and pool) and a neighborhood restaurant. It's definitely a locals spot, but I never feel like an outsider (which I actually do at some breweries). Their patio is expansive, well-shaded when you need it and a great place to drink in the summertime.\n\nThis review has gone on long enough, so I'll try to quit spouting praise for this establishment, but suffice it to say that it's one of our favorite watering holes and we'll continue to make the drive as long as this place is around. Three cheers for the Timber!"", ""This is a great clean neighborhood sports bar. They have a great on tap selection that changes regularly.  Both times I have been here they have had everything from a porter to a IPA. The first time I went I told the server I wanted to give the Souless Ginger a try. To my suprise she brought me a sample.  She apperantly  knew my taste better than I did, I went with the porter. My friend suggested we share some Queso fries, I ordered them the next time I came back. I'm not sure how to describe  them other than an amazing pile of hot deep fried seasoned fries smothered in some sort of queso style nacho sauce.  I was so ashamed of myself as I wiped the last of the cheese sauce from my mouth. I can't wait for the next Broncos game... TV'S abound they are on every wall in the place. Not all of the seats have a great view of the TV but the arrangement works well enough. I didn't go around the corner  but I heard they have a pool table and a shuffle board in the back.

With that in mind, time to back up a bit for opinion about Andrade\'s.  Once our favorite Mexican food eatery in the Treasure Valley where we have enjoyed a dozen-ish meals over the past three years and recommended it to scores of other diners. this last time in it was such a poor experience for food that we left not only disappointed but embarrassed. Because along with us was a friend who was in for her first Andrade\'s visit based on our unwavering recommendation.\n\nAlas, all three meals were so dry and lacking flavor that they were little edible.  So little so for my plate that our friendly server took half the cost of the dish off the bill.  Nice of her to do as none of us complained but we were honest when she asked, given none asked for take away box in spite of ample remainders on plates, ""Didn\'t you like the food?"" \n\nEvery place can have a bad day.  This I know. And as update note 2/18/19, I share that I heard from the owner who was good to be concerned.  See my UPDATE comments embedded to try to fairly address his comments. \n\nBut for three poor to nearly inedible dishes served at the shank-end of lunch hour (they make the turn from lunch to dinner menu at 3p, although dinner can be ordered during lunch hours too and dinner plates were ordered by two of us), was disquieting.\n\nAlso worth noting the salsa and bean dip that accompanies chips arrived in \'tasting sized\' little cups nearly impossible to use.  Our friend asked if we could get larger serving vessels as are normally used here.  The friendly server subsequently obliged with apologies that the dishware was dirty when we arrived and she had some washed for us.  This at a time when I recall fewer than eight people in the eatery with the lunch crowd long gone.  A little thing but nonetheless another thing suggesting things are not as fine tuned as before.\n\nThe menu has much expanded in the last months.   Is that why the food was not now as good?  Could the kitchen be over stretched? I don\'t know.  But we all ordered standard offerings like enchiladas and tamales.  The dinner plate portions were huuuuge but less of better quality is more in my view. \n\nAlso in the several months between our last visit and this one there has been a full bar added inside the main dining room.  Has the focus on food been lost in the transition?  I don\'t know.  But worth noting this addition for those interested.\n\nAll of this may not have been enough for me to give up on Andrade\'s without a follow up visit before deciding to take it off my \'favorites list\' but for two other items in a perfect storm.\n\nThe first of these was, as we exited, raw big sink in the kitchen piled high with what looked to me like raw chicken.  It was an \'ugh\' moment making me wonder if I wanted to eat here again.  (UPDATE:  The owner let me know this was a tray of thawed, raw breast meat which they use and on a tray over the sink getting ready for being washed / cleaned for safe use.)  Uncertainty reinforced the following week with the restaurant inspection news in the Boise paper (I read the report weekly) called out a handful of violations at Andrade\'s, a couple of which I considered significant on their own but in context of the several more disquieting still.  (UPDATE:  I assumed in my original comments that readers know how the process works.  For those who may not know here goes;  periodic health code inspections are unannounced and eateries are given X days - typically 10 days -  to correct the violations itemized by inspector and then there is reinspection.  So these were corrected.)\n\nOn the plus side, the people who work at Andrade\'s are have always been, most friendly and it remains a welcoming interior.  And more plus, although I didn\'t check it out, there is now a sign up at the entry with ""Family Bathroom"" which has unisex symbols and also a wheelchair icon and arrow pointing direction through an adjacent space. \n\nBut \'thinkin\' bout my Yelputation\' - to borrow and butcher the lyric from The Who\'s tune - I have to say I\'m lukewarm about returning to Andrade\'s after this visit.  \n\nWhat to you mean you don\'t know the tune?  Sure you do.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN5zw04WxCc', 'Neither the swankiest building nor in the best of locations but look closer and you see pride of place in keeping the front tidy and with lights strung as welcome and seasonal plantings in sidewalk pots.  That pride of ownership is carried through inside too in everything, starting with delicious food.  On each visit we\'ve also enjoyed warm ""all people are welcome"" vibe and friendly service.  Andrade\'s is easily our favorite of all Mexican restaurants in the Treasure Valley.   The single thing that keeps me shy of 5 stars is a big-ish hitch in the giddeyup because of the old infrastructure.  (See THIS N THAT.)\n\nVIBE:  This is an old building so if you\'re looking for flash and dazzle, you\'re going to need to hit up one of the chain joints.   (Good luck with that bad idea.)  But the interior is charming neighborhood style restaurant with evidence of the owner\'s pride in heritage.  As example, the great diorama that sits high on the wall above the dining room is a replica of his grandmother\'s house in Mexico.\n\nOn each visit we\'ve noted diners are all ages and walks of life; an ""all are welcome"" that appeals to us.  On one visit three young men dressed in USAF uniforms sat at one table, next to them a young family that spoke Spanish, across from them four senior citizens (who were clearly regulars) and at the booth next to us two guys in suits discussing marketing strategies.  Nice.\n\nFOOD:  I am grateful to the Yeep who sent me a message after seeing my review of a woeful experience at one of the flashy big chain outposts to suggest I try Andrade\'s for the best Mexican food in Boise.  She was right.  In fact, this is some of the best Mexican food we\'ve enjoyed anywhere.  I\'d put Andrade\'s mole in the same class as Nuestra Cocina\'s in Portland.  That is high praise.\n\nI won\'t recite menu options because you\'ll be able to find that information in other reviews.  But worth noting the salsa served at table with chips is  just one of several available at the salsa bar where you can help yourself.  A couple of those choices are tastebud incinerating level of spiciness that my husband thought perfect.\n\nAlso worth noting that in addition to animal protein options for filling enchiladas and tacos, Andrade\'s  has a really good vegetable combination that can be used for that too.  So if you\'re like me and love mole sauce but never quite \'get\' the chicken that typically comes with it, you can do veggie mole and be as happy as...well...a pig in mud!  This is authentic, dark, Mexican chocolate and spicy chile rich mole with not a hint of the peanut butter added to the ""mole 101 for beginners"" at chains .  Proceed accordingly.   I wanted to lick my plate.\n\nThe menu is extensive and every time each dish has been wonderful.  Including some specials my hubby ordered that seemed unique to Andrade\'s.\n\nSAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT:  The flan is remarkable.  Thanks to the server on our first visit who volunteered that she could pack it to go when we were too full to eat it after the meal   She said it was unlike any other and encouraged us to order it to go.  She was right.  Worth every calorie.\n\nSERVICE:  On our first visit when we were obviously new to the place our server was nice to take the time to answer our questions.  When I ordered mole she was also nice to ask if I\'d like a taste first.   She laughed when I asked if I looked like a gringa who didn\'t know what I was getting into.  When she replied ""Yes"" when I asked if it was the owner\'s grandmother\'s recipe I said no taste needed, I knew I would love it.  And I did, but she was both nice and professional to check back in soon after we started eating to be sure.   On subsequent visits the service has been as friendly, no matter how busy they may be.  Each time at the end of the meal the servers took the time to say ""I hope you\'ll come back.""\n\nLIBATIONS:  You walk in past a bar but I don\'t know if they have hard liquor.  I noted wine and beer but we treat ourselves to Jarritos with the meals.\n\nTHIS N THAT:\n\n1) PARKING:  Small lot.\n\n2) ACCESSIBILITY:  One \'sort of\' ADA spot.  Level in the door.  All on one level.  Standard height seating.  The loo is not accessible.\n\n3) LOO:  Bathrooms are small.   Not only impossible for people with mobility issues if they needed to get in with walker or wheelchair (increasingly possible for me as I have MS) but also might be impossible for zaftig sized people.  I can\'t imagine the remarkable Brittany Howard being able to squeeze in the door for example. The hitch that, absence of a bathroom all people can use,  keeps me from five stars.  May not seem important to you unless you can\'t get in to use it.\n\n4) WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON\'T KNOW BRITTANY HOWARD?:  Sure you do.  By voice at least.  See and hear her here.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwP_ydXgkWM', 'I hate to write less-than-stellar reviews.. I really do. I LOVE to give great places the praise they\'ve worked so hard to deserve. Its NOT easy to run a restaurant, or any type of establishment... especially in this shitty economy. \n\nSo last weekend, when I had a hankering for some delicious chips and salsa and a chile relleno, among other Mexican goodies... I, of course, checked in with my fellow yelpers to lead me in the right direction. This isn\'t like Southern California where you can throw a rock and hit 5 delicious Mexican joints. Hence why its taken me almost 2 months to even ATTEMPT to find a good Mexican restaurant.\n\nWhen I saw the decent reviews for Andrades, I was pretty excited, especially since I happened to be in the general vicinity at the moment. One reviewer even went as far to say that it was the best Mexican cuisine outside of Mexico. Well, I\'m assuming that he hasn\'t been to California recently. Because i was less than thrilled with Andrades.\n\nFirst of all, we arrived late Saturday afternoon. Like, 2:00 or so... Not really what I would call the ""rush"" hour of the restaurant world. Manfriend and I waited at the host area for a good ten minutes. Finally, after we still were not acknowledged... Manfriend found a kitchen worker and asked if we were to just seat ourselves, or.....   FINALLY, the one and only server working came to inform us that he was just cleaning off a booth and we would be sat as soon as he was finished. Swell.\n\nI do have to say, their menu is quite extensive, with all kinds of salads, combinations, tacos, burritos, seafood options, and carne. There are almost TOO many options, especially for my incredibly indecisive ass. One gripe that I do have, is that they seem to have a problem making any substitutions on the combos or anything else for that matter. Which I find incredibly odd.... at almost EVERY mexican restaurant Ive ever been to (which is ALOT), I\'ve had NO problem substituting things... especially when I am willing to pay for said substitution. \n\nFinally after about 2 baskets of chips and several cups of salsa... oh, and a pitcher of water (the server just left it on the table. good call), I was ready to order. I decided upon the 1 item combo, which was a pork tamale (they only have pork tamales... womp wompppp), and my sides were the chicken tortilla soup and a salad. Also, I ordered a chile relleno on the side, since I couldn\'t seem to get it as part of my actual combo... whatev.\n\nThe tamale was good... I guess.. no Long Beach Cinco De Mayo shit, but okay.. and the chile relleno was exceptional at best.. I just had a hard time NOT comparing each thing I had with my fave joints in CA. Made me rather homesick. Not a feeling you want to have when going out to eat in the city you decided to move to..\n\nI am still on the hunt for a GREAT Mexican place in Boise-area... let me know if you know of any... til then, my Yelpers. =(']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

The owner has been in there every time (manager perhaps?) and is always providing excellent customer service, asking me questions and telling me how important that it is for consistency, which I agree with. \n\nThe food is of good quality, tasteful, warm and filling. They have a different albeit Americanized balance to their food-- there is a salsa bar to help yourself to. Coke products. I\'ve tried a lot of things on the menu-- I prefer the shrimp tacos as they\'re super good. \n\nThe Tortilla Factory is located on a small strip of businesses near Walmart and Lowes near the Edwards Spectrum.

No, I mean it. Are those odd descriptors for an airport? Probably. How many hassles have I experienced in two decades of travelling through this airport on a semi annual basis? None. Zip. Zero. One terminal, two floors, small, logical design (I know right?), and friendly airport service individuals. If you\'ve seen the delightful film The Terminal, sometimes I think about those characters when I walk through this airport. The vibe is a good one, that\'s what I mean.\n\nBoise Airport is the busiest airport in the state of Idaho, second only to the dinky Idaho Falls airport in eastern Idaho that I nearly blinked and missed. Fun fact: this is also a military hub for the National Guard. ""Busiest"" is relative. I\'m here right now, coming back home from visiting my Auntie and cousins, and save for my gate and a flight currently deplaning, it is dead. I was the only person to go through security. When you choose the last flight out before NYE I guess that\'s how it goes. :-) Honestly I can\'t remember it ever being super crowded at this airport on arrival or departure. \n\nThe last thing I\'ll mention before pulling out the book I brought (hoping to finish it before the new year and reach my reading quota for the year) is that the rental car kiosks are all inside the airport right before the baggage claim area, on the left side as you ride the escalator down to the first floor upon arrival. So practical, so convenient! The cars are literally right outside and ready to go once you\'re squared away at the rental desk. \n\nMy favorite airport if I HAD to pick an airport. Come visit Idaho! It is an absolutely beautiful state, and perfect for you if you enjoy hiking, skiing, hot springs, and also if you enjoy wine the sunny slope region is calling your name. :-)', ""Easy peasy Boise! This little airport has all the noms and none of the petty ish that often plagues smaller city airports. \n\nSecurity? Friendly, fast and efficient. TSA pre check really feels like it here. They've got it down and dialed in. Huzzah. \n\nFoods? They've got new options for a smaller joint. The stores onsite have Boise items and some fresh eats too. It's nice to see things with some nutritional value offered. \n\nThe only qualm I had was that there was no Delta lounge onsite, but not really a surprise. \n\nThe parking and rental car areas are easy and walkable. There is a little reconstruction of a floor mural in the lobby going on so some of the direction signs could confuse you slightly - it's small though, so even being a little lost will probably get you to your gate. \n\nGood job Boise! You could teach Fresno a thing or two. Rawr!"", ""Boise Airport is the airport in Boise. It also happens to be a pretty decent regional airport with a mix of jets and smaller planes serving the area. Only a handful of flights visit the relatively small metro area so the airport shares with a military base. The airport is south of downtown with easy access to Interstate 94. \n\nI arrived on Southwest and departed on Alaska. The Southwest flight arrived in the main terminal while the Alaska flight used the lower gates with the outdoor walkway. Obviously the interior gates are more comfortable, but you don't have a choice with the smaller planes used by Alaska. \n\nThe airport is modern and large, although there are few flights. They have a nice food court with several good options. Souvenir shopping is surprisingly bland, but they do sell Idaho wine in the gift shops. WiFi was free and fast, but spotty with drop off. \n\nCheck in was a breeze. Baggage claim was fast. The rental car area didn't even have a gate. Everyone was nice and friendly.

I have lived in the area for 20 years and walk past this establishment at least three times a week. I finally went in with my dearest friend for a quick bite. As i walked in i instantly noticed the old school diner ambiance and the classic tunes from my parents era (which i love!). \n\nThe service was very prompt and we chose the bouncing booth to receive our entrees. I looked over the menu and found a very enticing item. French Dip. Mmmmmm. I had flash backs of my aunts french dip and was wondering if Eddie's had the comfort food/sandwich chops to pull it off. My good friend ordered a simple chef salad.\n\nAbout ten minutes later both of our Entrees arrived. Dang Gina!! The presentation was very simple, but the taste and texture was perfect. The bun was toasted with care and the cheddar cheese was melted perfectly. The meat was soft and flavorful. Then comes the Au Jus to save the day! All four components sing together and the chefs where trained correctly in the fine comfort food arena. \n\nFabulous Job Eddie's! I will be back to devour your breakfast menu items that looked quite tantalizing as well.\n\nTill next time...."", ""A 50's diner, with great service!  For emphasis, this is a 50's diner, with great service!  So, with that being said, I will explain. The seating is crazy.  Booths on the sides, and long tables in the middle.  You are very close to your neighbor if your at the tables in the middle.  I heard their conversation, and could hear him eating.  (Yuk!)  That is too close for me.  I ordered the vegetable skillet.  One piece of broccoli and some random broccoli stems, over a bed of potatoes.  It was like they forgot the vegetables!  Being a 50's diner, it was very loud and very busy.  (Totally expected that)  Coffee was average.  Service was great.  Sometimes I think restaurants get good at what they do, and then they forget why they do it.  The business of serving mass people can make the kitchen forget that people come there for the food.  They come back because the food and service.  When one or the other lacks, you look for options.  I think if they were to slow the pace down a little, adjust the seating and remind the kitchen to make sure the plate is full of what made them famous, people would be lined up around the block!  Eating out is more then getting the customer in and out the door.  Great food and service makes for repeat customers!  Not that I won't go back, I would just probably leave it as an option."", ""So this is an updated review. The first time I came in, I was less than impressed. The service was apathetic, the food was mediocre, and the music was too loud. I was asked back to give them another try and I did.  The second experience was much better. \n\nWhen you walk in, the hostess is still not very good.  She didn't greet us but she did get us seated quickly enough.  She also didn't tell us who our server was or how long we should expect to wait for her. I was not impressed with her customer service. \n\nIt took about fifteen minutes before our server showed up to take our drink order, but that wasn't a problem for me because I like a little extra time to read over the menu and I could see that they were busier than the last time I came in. If you're the type of person who likes fast service, I might suggest going in the afternoon when they aren't quite so busy. Our waitress was much nicer this time around and brought my toddler's food out early for her because she was getting very fussy waiting.  The food took a long time but the waitress checked in frequently and was very sweet to us. \n\nSo on to the food.  I ordered the steak and eggs breakfast. Please keep in mind that this is a diner style restaurant with very low prices. If you're looking for five star organic food, I might suggest a higher end restaurant. That being said, the steak and eggs was decent (marginally better than the skillet I had ordered previously). I ordered medium rare and it came out medium well, but it was seasoned nicely.  Was it the nicest cut of steak? Eh, probably not.  But for a $9 meal, it sure beats what you'd get at a fast food place for the same price! As usual the portion sizes were large.  My husband ordered a burger and he enjoyed it. My daughter ordered pancakes again this time and they came out nicely (last time they were overcooked), so that was better. \n\nAs for the environment, the music was much lower this time, so that was better (last time they had it blasted so loud that I couldn't hear). The whole restaurant has an old-fashioned diner theme, which I feel like might be more appealing to Idaho natives (I'm from Portland). The biggest appeal of this place is the fact that they give you large portions for being so inexpensive.  \n\nSo I'm not really sure where to rate this restaurant. I wish I could do a 3.75 because that's about where I feel they are. Almost four stars but not quite. Hmm.  Last time I gave them two stars, but since the service and food improved, I'll would say it's four stars (averaging out my visits). Overall, a big improvement""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

For location, vibe, food, service, gourmet and home gift options, we enjoyed it all.  Thanks to the friendly staff who made us feel welcome.  \n\nVIBE\nBuilding seems re-purposed from a garage with big doors rolled up in nice weather.  Open interior with lots of seating at communal and individual standard height (hooray) tables and chairs throughout. More seats on the patio in the front.  \n\nPart café, part deli, part gourmet market, part bakery and espresso bar, part cookbook library, part home and kitchen gifts and accessories in a high ceiling open concept space divided up with seating and displays. \n\nI\'ve read criticism focused, no kidding, on the fact that most of the clientele are female and of a certain age.  That may be true but on the day of our visit, I\'d say the people enjoying the patio and inside were about evenly split between men and women and across age groups.  Not that the gender or age of people there should be a thing at all. But since it has been a thing for critics, thought I\'d offer my observation.\n\nSERVICE\nFrom the moment we walked in the door and were greeted by the young woman at the bakery / coffee bar counter through our ordering of breakfast and coffee to our ordering of take out to take home, service was friendly and efficient.  It was also very nice of them to provide us with a zip loc bag of ice to use in our cooler so we could order deli take out items to go with us for the several hour drive home.\n\nTHE DRILL\n Order at the deli counter, including your coffee order, take a number and they\'ll deliver to your table.  They also clear for you after you\'re done so no need to bus your own. \n \nFOOD\nSo many choices on the menu at the counter and in the deli case.  For breakfast we shared (it is big enough for sure) a chile relleno baked dish ($6.95) .  Also small side of the broccoli, red grapes and almond salad to go with my breakfast.  (Seriously.)  Both tasty enough.  \n\nThe bold roast coffee was great, served piping hot in 12 oz mugs ($1.95).\n\nWe bought several take out items to have for an easy meal when we got home later that day after a long drive.  The picante tuna salad was good.  Some of the other selections weren\'t as flavorful as I hoped. More what I\'d describe as ""caterer buffet quality"".  Deli items rotate frequently so it seems there might always be something new to try.\n\nThe bakery case is too tempting to pass by.  We thought the baked goods better than the deli items.  Next visit to Boise would find us here for coffee and bakery only.\n\nPRICES\nNoting some have referenced this as break the bank pricing, I\'ll offer counterpoint that for my husband and me the deli food prices seemed reasonable for a gourmet / specialty store .  Could be visitors who live elsewhere have a different frame of reference for pricing than locals.  But comparing this to Oakville Grocery or Dean and Deluca, as analogs, in some of our old stomping grounds of SF area or NYC area or even food to go from food trucks in our current home in Bend, the prices here seemed reasonable to us for food items.  The gifts and housewares seemed spendy.\n\nGO SLOW HOME / GIFT SHOPPING\nAll kinds of pretty and handsome items for personal care, like soaps and lotions, or home, kitchen and gift items like candles, trivets, books, cookware, linens...the list goes on and on.  A friend of mine calls this kind of store a ""go slow shop"" since you can see a new treasure tucked everywhere. Spendy, for sure, still I purchased gifts here that I didn\'t find elsewhere.\n\nACCESSIBILITY\nUniversally accessible design from level in and throughout and standard table height seating.  Loo accessible too.  Parking lot needs work for ADA compliance.  \n\nHOURS\nMon - Fri 7 - 6  Sat 7 - 5\n\nLOCATION / PARKING\nJust outside the downtown core at 15th and Grove.  Has its\' own parking lot.', 'Holy Cougarville, Northenders!  I went here for lunch this past Wednesday, and it was packed with what I would describe as an influx of overly-groomed Highland dwellers coming down into the valley to graze--lots of girlfriend lunch dates (dressed as if fresh off a jog or yoga stretch), mid-life crisis Joes, and well-off retirees.  There is an ample section of prepared foods and sandwich options at the deli counter to suit just about anyone. Breads  were fresh. Meats of decent quality.  Sides tasty (would highly recommend the Moroccan eggplant salad).  Careful of the question, ""chip or salad with the sandwich?"" The latter is a $4 up-charge.  I also tried the chicken and pepper enchilada (more like a casserole) and found it quite tasty, and filling.\n\nThe coffee and sweets side of the space did not stack up as well.  Dawson Taylor is decent coffee, and they\'re local, but they are really a little ""blah"" in the trend toward really delicious coffee.  The new Crux coffeehouse has keyed into this with their choice of Stumptown (Portland) beans, as has Salt N Tears with Doma (Post Falls, ID).  If they wanted to stay local, I think they should have hooked up with Flying M\'s Purple Bean.  What can I say, I\'m a coffee snob.  I didn\'t much like my selected bake good, either, which was some sort of walnut, caramel bar.  The ""flaky"" portion was much too floury and came off as chalky, and the caramel part was more akin to overly sweet noughat (which I love when done well in the Italian fashion). Just the right amount of toasted nut, though.\n\nOverall a good addition to food choices in downtown.

I\'m not sure why she even had to share that and could not have nicely said that she did not have plug ins.  Or, maybe tried to figure out a way to accommodate us - a plug in in the back or in the bathroom if you need a quick charge.  One or two plug-ins is not going to create loitering.  This is the 21st century for goodness sake!  This is just one in a line of several times the staff has been rude.  We promptly headed over to Whole Foods where the staff was so welcoming, there are lots of plug ins, the view was amazing and the food was ever bit as good as A Tavola - and, cheaper!!!

If you want great gourmet deli-style food, head over to Whole Foods or the Boise Co-op.  \n\nMy point was driven home because when we went into A Tavola at 10:30 am - there was only one other person in the entire place.

When walking, a pedestrian must be constantly on their guard and that is not the kind of welcome one expects. What was the person who signed-off on this design thinking? Ridiculous.\n\nAs for the food and other aspects to the restaurant, I have no idea why this place is so wildly popular - it is fast food fried chicken and waffle fries after all. Maybe people are used to eating bad fried chicken or something and this is a cut above other fast food places that when one consumes mediocre it actually seems to taste good?\n\nMy experience didn't convince me to become a regular, but this Chic-fil-A does deserve some praise for its execution in the QSR category.  The restaurant was squeaky clean, the fried chicken was hot as were the waffle fries, and the counter people were friendly and efficient.

You better believe it.\n\nThis Chick-fil-A has been my trusty friend on those long days where cooking isn\'t an option and waffle fries are calling my name. Their service is quick and friendly! And if they mess up your order, they make it right...and then some. \n\nMy roomie and I picked up dinner here (via the drive-thru) a few weeks ago. When we got home (we live less than a mile away) we realized that they left out one of our orders of fries. We drove back through and told them that they left out a medium fry. They apologized and when we got to the window they gave us a large fry and a coupon for a free entree during our next visit!\n\nNow on to the food - it\'s always served hot and fresh! Each visit I\'ve had here has been consistently excellent. As far as what to order, well, everyone has their preference at Chick-fil-A. But if you ask me, get a Chick-Fil-A chicken sandwich, fries, Chick-fil-A sauce, ranch, and if you\'ve thrown calorie counting out the window, an Oreo milkshake...and feel no regrets. But if you are counting calories and are looking for something semi-guilt-free (is that even a real thing??), I love their chicken cool-wraps with balsamic vinaigrette and a small fry on the side (because how could I not?), so yummy!']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0

There are joggers, bikers, dog walkers, and families with kids. Small and big parks can be found along the trail, and there are lots of small businesses along the way as well. In certain parts of the river you can see ducks, and in other parts there are spaces for water sports. One Saturday morning I happened upon a farmers market and then visited every Saturday until it got too cold. I love the various views from the trail, and the sounds of flowing water, birds, and other animals makes you forget that you're in a city."", ""The Boise River Greenbelt is an absolute local gem.\n\nFor 25 miles, along the Boise River as it meanders through Boise (including downtown), we have the Greenbelt.  A beautiful, paved path wide enough to have two lanes of foot/cycle traffic (stay to the right, yo!).  On the weekend, during pleasant weather, the Greenbelt will be packed with cyclists, walkers, roller bladers, and skate boarders--heck I've even seen unicyclists.  And, many of those walkers, cyclists, & etc will have their canine companions on leash along with them.  \n\nBut, even if the weather isn't particularly fine--you'd be hard pressed to ever find the Greenbelt deserted during daylight hours.  There will be cycle commuters rushing to and fro and hard core runners and walkers out in all kinds of weather.  \n\nOther than the gorgeousness of the area surrounding the river to enjoy, one fascination that I can never seem to resist stopping for is the Boise River Park where wave shapers create waves in the river for kayakers and surfers to enjoy.  They are amazing to watch and there is a nice stone/paved area where people can lounge and watch the water sport fun.\n\nOverall, a lovely feature to our lovely city.  The Boise River Greenbelt is truly a highlight of a city full of highlights and just one of the many things that makes life in Boise just so damn grand.\n\nGet to it!"", ""Coming from a city where there only thing worse than the traffic is the inclination to BIKE RIDE in said bad traffic, the Boise River Greenbelt is like that sacred light emanating from God's head over the endless horizon of dopey motorists and orange traffic cones.\n\nThe path is over 20 miles long, almost 30, taking into account the side routes and runs through many Boise neighborhoods and suburbs.  You can run, walk, skip, bike, do the hokey pokey and if you get tired, there are plenty of spots for you to relax and enjoy the scenery, most of which follows the river.  \n\nHave biked several times on this trail, starting west at the parking lot of a wastewater treatment plant and ending up all the way at the dam (east) at one point.  Have also gone further west.  The road is mainly unbroken, except for certain spots - paved and flat, and free of people most weekdays.  However, there is construction at certain points of the path, so check latest conditions before hauling out your loved ones for a (potentially) short excursion.\n\nBiking along the greenbelt is a great way to get a sense of what Boise's all about - green and lush in the summer, uber-friendly people (you'll think you've died and gone to Walton heaven, where pretty much everyone you pass says HI or smiles at you...but not idiotically, like I'm inclined to do), well-maintained public spaces, families with their and dogs kids out, people out or in the water, with a backdrop of the trees and the water.  It's like a Thomas Kinkade painting on steroids.\n\nThe city government also spends $$ taking care of its spaces.  After a thunderstorm, crews were out cutting down wayward tree branches and clearing the road of brush.  (They also smiled and waved HI at us.)  While most people like myself are from cities where trying not to get swallowed by a large pothole is considered the favorite local pastime, the greenbelt is a great addition to Boise.""]",0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,

This is my 386th Yelp Review. \n\nI like this place. I've visited here a few times. It seems to be an upgraded Los Betos. The food seems to be presented much better, cleaner, and more professional. The prices are higher than Beto's but you get what you pay for."", ""Good, simple Mexican fare offered at reasonable prices, ordered at the counter and delivered by friendly people to your table in a cavernous but sparkling clean dining area.  Not destination dining for us, but if in the neighborhood again, we would return here.  If you read no further than this, here's a tip:  don't miss the salsa bar as it may be second only to Andrade's for good, incendiary salsa offerings.\n\nTHE SERVICE & THE DRILL:  Friendly people work at the counter where one orders from a limited menu of traditional offerings like tacos and enchiladas and burritos displayed on menu board over head.  Find a seat in the dining area and some of the same friendly folks will deliver a basket of chips and bowls of salsa and queso to your table and, in what seems like a flash, also the food you ordered which is served on real plate not disposables.  Hooray!   No need to bus your own; they will also stop by to pick up your plates when you're finished. \n\nTHE FOOD:  We shared adobada tacos ($1.35 each) and a plate of two enchiladas verde that came with refried beans, rice, shredded lettuce and tomatoes ($9) which  along with the chips and salsa left the two of us comfortably full for under twelve bucks.  \n\nThe salsa bar has about half a dozen choices that range from mild, the one served at the table too, to hot as Hades with most of them in the mid-incendiary range.  Nice!  Also some cabbage crudo, sliced radishes, pickled carrots and wedges of lime that can be used to customize your dishes as you choose.\n\nWe were a bit disappointed to find the food offerings didn't include items  with complex Mexican sauces like mole. (Andrade's is the place for those dishes and is the destination Mexican restaurant in Boise for us.)  For my sodium content watching friends I also offer that we found our dishes very much salted, maybe too much, but that could just be a personal preference issue.\n\nTHE VIBE:  Dining and open kitchen were once home to a couple of fast food places and so both are really large.   Walk in past the black laminate topped tables and booths with blueberry-purple vinyl seats to the order counter at the back.  \n\nWe loved that all the seating was standard height and no high counter stool seating to be found  Hooray!  We also loved the Mexican music on the sound system.\n\nWe appreciated that the entire place was sparkling clean.\n\nTwo TVs, one on each side of the room, were turned to different stations, one news and the one near the booth we sat on to an obnoxious animated program with adult content of things like masturbation jokes turned loud enough to hear it. For what it's worth, I'd leave the TVs off unless tuned to Mexican station programming to add to the vibe.\n\nACCESSIBILITY:  Level in the door, all on one level, clear path of travel to the order counter, standard height seating, accessible loo.  The salsa bar is out of reach range, so people who can't stand to access it would need assistance.\n\nPARKING: Big private lot in the strip mall location for what was a fast food place.  Inexplicably, the strip mall owner is in violation of Federal Law (ADA) and Idaho Building Code Access Chapter for failing to provide a single designated accessible (aka ADA) parking spot, let alone the several the code and law have both required since 1990 for a lot with this many spaces. \n\nHOURS: Open as early as 7:30a.m. and stay open until 10p.m. seven days a week.  If so, think about all the hard work needed by so many people to keep it so!"", ""The Boise Valley has a large number of Mexican restaurants but very few stand out. \n\nMost serve up the same lineup of bland, Americanized Mexican food. Taqueria La Flama is breaking the mold.\n\nSalsas can make the difference between an OK Mexican restaurant and one that shines. Here, they have a salsa bar with several varieties, radish slices, lime wedges and a type of cabbage curtido.\n\nThe best is a guacamole with a chile kick. It's the best salsa I've tasted in Boise.\n\nSo far, I've tasted their tacos and a mulita, meat and melted cheese sandwiched between two corn tortillas. \n\nThey are excellent. \n\nAlthough more of a fast food eatery, they deliver your dishes to your table and bring you a basket of chips, a tomato salsa and queso. [Edited] As of Nov. 1, they no longer provide free chips. They now charge $3 for chips and queso.\n\nArctic Circle and Speedy Burger didn't last very long in this same spot on busy Fairview Avenue.

Reading the reviews was most amusing...""best west of the Mississippi""? LOL!! We thought we might try it because it had four ""stars"", but the whole meal was a laugh. My Japanese friend wanted to try the Pearl Harbor Roll just because she was so offended by the name. It bombed too, and I was thoroughly embarrassed and was FAR beyond offended. \n\nThe fish was cut too thin. There was no vinegar in the rice, which made it extremely bland. Normally, each fish has a distinct flavor, but none of it had any flavor and if I closed my eyes, I couldn\'t tell the difference from one to the other, and I have a VERY experienced palette when it comes to Japanese food. I could very easily deduce that no one working at that restaurant has probably studied proper sushi making in Japan. Maybe they changed planes there when coming to the US, but that\'s all. When I was going to order one particular roll (on a dare from my Japanese friend), the waitress was kind enough to tell us ""I wouldn\'t recommend that."" I\'m grateful for her honesty. \n\nIt\'s such a shame that people will go to this restaurant and think they are eating sushi. There is a vague resemblance (not the rolls, just the nigiri), but that\'s were all similarities end. Flavorless fish cut incorrectly, served on rice that was not prepared properly, and then drowned in sauces that should never cross the threshold of a ""Japanese"" restaurant. We were both so disappointed the well meaning customers would walk away with the wrong impression what a beautiful food sushi can actually be. \n\nTo make matters worse, we were told that because we were ordering off of the ""all you can eat"" menu (first mistake), we would be charged if we didn\'t eat anything. I felt like I was taken hostage. We could only eat a couple of pieces of the last two rolls, not because we ordered too much and we were full, but because the taste was so disgusting and we didn\'t want to risk getting sick. So we had no choice but to leave the extra $10 on the bill for the left-over food, which I thought was robbery to begin with. $70 for an awful experience!! \n\nAn hour after the meal I\'m sitting in my hotel writing this review and have begin getting a headache. I hope it stops at that and I don\'t end up with dysentery. The owners of this restaurant should be ashamed of themselves for trying to pass this off to unknowing customers as being Japanese. They should go to Japan once and spend a few months learning how to make it correctly. Not that the management could read it, but even the signs on the wall written in Japanese were incorrect and irrelevant to what was being served!!\n\nOur waitressed sensed our displeasure, and didn\'t even come back to the table after she dropped off the bill.

So you can add your party onto the Live waiting list on this same app that you're reading this review, how awesome?!! \n\nOk, so here's my issue: \nThe names of the rolls have little to no relation to the ingredients in the sushi! I think that because it's located across the street from the movie theaters that a lot of the rolls are movie references. The confusing names just make it hard to skim the menu and remember what you may have ordered in the past. \nAnother personal preference that affects my rating is that I'm not a fan of cream cheese in sushi and a lot of  Yoi Tomo's rolls have cream cheese in it.

I was getting punished for my gluttony. And deservedly so!\n\nHowever, the server talked to her manager about my situation, and they both decided that I was only a hungry soul who had just come from playing three hours of volleyball, and that I had no bad intentions. Instead of paying $40 for my leftover, I was asked to pay only $20. I got to take my sizable leftover home, of course. Needless to say, I had to give the server a generous tip.\n\nLesson learned: Don\'t be a glutton when it comes to AYCE! Lol.\n\nShogun Sushi is located in Southeast Boise. I\'ve been there a few more times after my humiliating experience and have been smarter with my choices. Most recently, I skipped AYCE and ordered pork teriyaki. It was a little bland, in my opinion. But props to them for being generous with the veggies. I am a huge fan of their baked salmon. It\'s my go-to sushi.\xa0\n\nI\'m giving this place four stars because while food is decent, the sushi is rice-heavy. Not a lot of seafood or meat. It\'s mostly rice.

We went for an early dinner to avoid the crowds and paid dinner price for the all you can eat sushi.

She was very attentive and provide excellent service.  In one of the reviews, they mention the seared tuna salad and how they could eat that daily.  I would have to agree.  Only on the dinner all you can eat option can you have the seared ahi salad.  It was excellent.  It had a great salad dressing and the tuna was very fresh.  The sushi was very well done as well including fresh fish and creative combos.  Their all you can eat also included appetizers which were really good.\n\nAll in all, I would definitely come back.  I do have to mention that the seared ahi salad makes this review lean towards excellence.  Since it is not included in the all you can eat lunch, I probably would only come back to pay their dinner prices so that I could indulge on their salad.

I\'m half Japanese and would like to say I have a somewhat good idea of what good sashimi is. Obviously we are not in Tsukiji fish market Tokyo but man this is good. The fish was cold, firm, and had a great texture. No bad odors or funny tastes. The only one that was off was the seared tuna (little tough). Rice was warm, fresh, and cooked to perfection (rice is just as much a part of sushi as the fish... not just a vehicle to inhale more fish). Compare that to grocery store sushi where the rice is cold and borderline crunchy. The actual venue is quaint with several tables and and a bar section. Here is my gripe with (almost) every sushi joint in America; why all the cream cheese? Half of asia is lactose intolerant; cheese is not a big thing! The idea of cream cheese in sushi equates to putting soy sauce on top of ice cream instead of chocolate sauce?????? But we are in #merica; land of the supersized fry and diet coke, and have to put our #merica twist on things. Whats next? Gravy covered sushi rolls? Ok off the soapbox. It was great for Boise. What would I have liked to see? It would be so neat to see a new sushi joint simplify their menu, get rid of cheesy things like ""the micron roll"" or ""the bogus roll"", deviate from the cream cheese kick, and focus on high quality simple nigiri.

I ordered a small 12 oz iced vanilla latte (low on the ice) and a Club Panini (salami, pepperoni, turkey, cheddar cheese and onions, $6.00). I enjoyed my coffee, it did the job and tasted great. However I was mildly disappointed with the panini! The bread was very tough, like someone had microwaved it once, forgot about it and microwaved it again. I'm almost 90% sure this happened, because it also took for freaking ever to get this one lil sando. It was also very dry. I don't believe there was any cheese at all, and there were no onions. Unfortunately I ordered this to-go, so I wasn't able to request a remake. \n\nOverall, Alchemist has potential. The coffee is already great.

A great place to stop in and get some street tacos. The tacos are made right in front of you and there are lots of creations for you to chose from. Dieting? No problem, just get them without the tortilla and you have a carb free meal! \n\n356th person to review Tin Roof Tacos in Boise Idaho near St Lukes hospital on Broadway. This is my 458th review. \n\nThey have a patio that you can chillax in and some large sized tables on the inside. There isn\'t much room at all and can get busy, but its all in the experience, right and as long as you have tacos, good tacos, then everything\'s gonna be alright my friends. \n\nAs Tim D said in his review... ""Now, stop reading this review and order you some tacos""! Here here, Tim D.!', 'The tacos were even better than the buzz!  The tastiest street-TexMexAmerican-style tacos we\'ve had in all of Treasure Valley.   Arguably anywhere north of Austin.  If you need more than that recommendation, here are things  to know before you go...\n\nBACK STORY:  The friendly guy behind the counter told us this was started by a couple of sisters who relocated from Texas to Boise and noticed the absence of street-style taco places here.  Filling the niche, they opened Tin Roof.  Aren\'t all of our taste buds tickled for their entrepreneurship!   (I\'d love to know how the nifty name came to be.  If I have a chance to meet the owners, I\'ll ask.)  \n\nFORWARD TIP:  I hear another Tin Roof is planned for Meridian.  El hurra!  Times two for that cheer since it will NOT be in the Village mall.  (Who wants to go to a big shopping mall and fight the parking to eat?  Not you?   Me neither.)\n\nVIBE: Located at a little strip mall not far from downtown and with neighbors that include a dry cleaner and yogurt shop, this is a sparkling clean and \'all are welcome\' kind of place.  For seating there are several long communal tables with chairs inside and also some high counters and chairs on one wall and at kitchen.  There are more tables and chairs outside on a covered patio with a funky-fun-firepit.  They have allowed ample room at the order counter and in the aisle way to get from food pick up counter to the tables. Seating at tables may be a tight squeeze in busy times.  One TV in the corner (with sound off when we were there - thank goodness.)\n\nSERVICE:  Do friendly folks make terrific tacos taste even better?  Maybe.  The people at the service counter and in the open kitchen space sure are delightful.  And the time from placing order to calling our name for order being up was ""flash fast"".\n\nDRILL:  Menu is posted on big, clear to read signs on  the wall to the left of the order counter.  It lists six breakfast tacos (available all day) and fourteen others including two pork, two chicken, three veggie (yahoo! says me), two seafood and five beef options. Order at the counter and when your meal is ready they\'ll call your name to pick it up to carry to your seat at a table...or to go with you.  \n\nEATS:   We shared four tacos between two of us; one of the pork and all of the veggies tacos.  Each was delicious with fresh ingredients and flavors on very good corn tortillas.  (The tortillas came to them formed and par baked and they finish them off on the in house tortilla \'grill\'.)  The tacos were very tasty just as served.  Next time we\'ll also try some of the sauces in squeeze bottles at the counter...tomatillo (mild), red chile (spicy), and orange (habanero hot).  The tacos are served inside cardboard containers and all placed on a nice round Tin Roof tray to make it easy to carry and eat them.\n\nVALUE:  Breakfast tacos are only $2 each, seafood options are $2.50 and the others $2.25.  A bargain for this great product!\n\nACCESSIBILITY: I have MS so pay particular attention to equal access. (I bet the Governor of Texas, a man who uses a wheelchair due to an accident, does too.)  Level in the door and all on one level.  Tables are standard height with chairs that can be moved if necessary for wheelchair access.  Patio is fully accessible with some tables there as well.  Good for them. \n\nPARKING:  Parking is at a premium in Boise so a big advantage for this location is the small strip mall parking lot.  ADA parking spaces included.  \n\nTIMING IS EVERYTHING:  Want to avoid the long line which can sometimes form here (for good reason) or to be able to have a group find seats together?

The Boise location is the 21st installment of\xa0a California chain started in 2009.  (Kudos to the two guys who had the chutzpah to start a food chain during that recession).  From my perch Eureka! is to the 2000\'s into 2020\'s decades as Red Robin was to the 1970\'s to 1990\'s.  This is formula-place, the same menu and schtick at each chain location.  One visit was enough for us to know we won\'t go back on our own steam.\xa0 If someone suggested Eureka!, we would try to talk them out of it and in to one of the other places on 8th like Wild Root, Bittercreek or Red Feather.  (Examples didn\'t  include 8th Street located Matador - a chain Mexican food place.)  \n\nVIBE:   Part of Eureka\'s success for 21 locations expansion is interior design that fits the local \'hipstah\' community for each city there are in.  So the interior design here, although dark in the bar and interior seating spaces on the other side of the bar, is just enough ""Boise funky"" to grab attention in a good way.  There is also a biig outdoor patio at front and roll up garage door for warmer weather months.  Seating in the bar is all awkward high perch.\xa0 Seating in other parts of the restaurant includes tight-spaced standard height tables.  It is LOUD.\n\nSERVICE:  People who work here were welcoming but the ""team service"" Eureka! touts in their business profile (see corporate web page) was like a Keystone Cops routine.  It is a different thing  to have a service team with a lead backed up by his or her peers when they are tied up. That works.\xa0 But Eureka!\'s  is a ""relay"" approach and the problem is as the service-relay baton gets handed off it is dropped repeatedly.  This meant for us:\n\n* Once seated a server came tableside to greet us and answer menu questions.\n* Still another took the beverage order.\n* Still another came by to ask if we wanted  to place beverage order at which point we said already done. ""Oh. OK.""\n* Still another delivered 1/2 of beverage order and was surprised when we said ""there was more to this"".\xa0  ""Oh.  I\'ll check.""\n* Still another delivered drink order part 2.\n*First server took food order and said ""No problem"" when we asked for apps first and veggie burger afterwards.\n* Looong wait before still another server delivered lukewarm apps and hot veggie burger all at once.  (Seems apps were waiting in the kitchen since no one was aware of need to deliver them first.) ""Oh. Sorry.""\n* At end of meal one of the servers asked if we\'d like dessert.\xa0 We said ""Coffee first, please, but yes we\'re considering dessert."",  and then...\n*Still another server set the bill on our table without coffee presented or dessert order taken.\xa0 Perhaps because the not so good lukewarm apps were left uneaten this server assumed, not having talked to the previous server, that we neither ordered coffee nor wanted dessert.\n\nAt which time we gave up and left.  \n\nIn exploring further we found the chain actually thinks this ""passing the baton"" relay service is a good thing and touts it on their website.  Problem is dropped batons.\xa0 Nice people.\xa0 Process is the problem.\n\nFOOD: This is formula food - each Eureka! is same menu.  (You know.  Like Red Robin.  Or Applebee\'s.)  There are burgers aplenty.  We appreciated the veggie burger (BEET based) could be ordered with any of the beef burger toppings. The pork riblet app and Brussels sprouts were not good.\xa0 It wasn\'t only that they were served lukewarm, but the Brussels were oily and the pork tough.\xa0 Not like us to leave leftovers, we reuse them at home, but they weren\'t worth the transport.\n\nPortions are moderate in size.  We think this is a good thing in the \'more is better\' era in chain food service.\n\nPRICES:Spendy for the quality and portion size.\n\nLIBATIONS:\xa0 First a \'non-octane\' tip.\xa0 They make their own ginger-lime soft beverage here and it is a winner.\xa0 Their schtick is as \'brown\xa0bar\' for local whiskeys and beers.\xa0 (A big circle is drawn to define local.)\xa0 I\'m a whiskey lovin\' person so that might appeal to me were the whiskey served elsewhere.  The lofty prices of some pours here gives me shivers.\n\nTHIS N THAT:\n\n1) PARKING:\xa0 On 8th is almost always non existant.\xa0 Park and hike from other streets or garages.\n\n2) ACCESSIBILITY:\xa0 Given Eureka!\'s CA HQ, the chain does a pretty good job.\xa0 That said there is no standard height seating in the bar (should be) and it seemed it might be\xa0a tight gauntlet between seating for a wheelchair user to get to the loo when highchairs were at booth ends.\xa0 (ADA requires 36"" clear in aisles and between seats.)\xa0 Loo is accessible.\xa0\n\n3) LOO:\xa0 In a hallway outside the restaurant but inside the building.\xa0 You\'ll need a security code for the door to get into the loo.\xa0 Write it on your wrist to remember it if you\'ve had too much at the \'brown bar\'. ;-)', ""Alright, I did the responsible thing and came here twice before writing a review.\n\nSo far: PRETTY EFFING GOOD!\n\nThe happy hour deal, for a new, fancy, semi-expensive place, blows away most other happy hours in the area. It features some amazing appetizers (one of the best bruschettas plates I've ever tasted; osso bucco riblets; fried chicken sliders; fried brussels sprouts with a sticky glaze) for pretty decent prices, not to mention discounts on their (extensive, thoughtful, eclectic) tap list, wine list, and select liquors (Buffalo Trace bourbon and a vodka that I forgot... don't tread on me vodka... something). It's worth mentioning that their house wine is a wonderful cab from Paso Robles, a region that produces amazing cabs and zins.\n\nI've also tried the marrow burger, which is just insanely decadent and rich... very, very tasty, but a once-in-a-lifetime pick for me. I need a little more balance in flavor. We also tried the lobster tacos, which were great but could use some improvement (if management wants to talk, I truly think we have minor changes that would very positively affect the experience). The truffle fries rock... it's just hard to pick a bad item here.\n\nI always neglect peripheral qualities, but the atmosphere and interior are so damn relaxing, the servers are super polite and attentive, and I really can't think of one thing to complain about.\n\nOh, well, the restroom is a communal one, meaning you walk down a shared hallway and use a code to get in. If that's the worst thing that happens to you, you're doing a lot better than most of us.\n\nCannot say enough good things. Try this place now!"", ""We were lucky enough to be invited to their soft opening for lunch today. All the employees were super helpful and def on their best behavior. We shared an appetizer, their smoked chicken nachos. It was a nice size for 3 people to share, but if there are more in your group I would suggest ordered another app. For my entree, I ordered their blue burger. It had blue cheese, caramelized onions, and herbed mushrooms. The flavors melded great, the burger was super moist and flavorful, and the cheese didn't overpower the dish. If I had one suggestion, I would ask they reformulate the fixings so that they would stay inside the burger when I life it to my mouth. That said, the burger was a bit messy and hard to keep together. For dessert, we had their apple cobbler. They topped it with vanilla bryers ice cream and candied pecans. Very good!!!  \n\nAbout the restaurant: Perfect for a date night spot. They have at least 20 beers on tap at all times. Service is on-point. Prices on entrees range from $12-24. Happy hour goes from 2-6 and again 9-close. HH appetizers seem to be about $2 off full price. On Tuesdays the special is 50% off glasses of wine.""]",0.5,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,1.0,30.0

Liked it fine to have tried it once but it wouldn\'t be destination again for me.  The brewed coffee was good enough, it just wasn\'t what I prefer - on the day of my visit they had only two medium roast options available.  There were no ""just-a-little-something"" food options available to go with the brew but a couple of donuts and what looked like a few shrink wrapped scones.  Also, the majority of table seating is high perch and those bar height seats don\'t work for me.  Also because, Oy Vey, the booming music selections really didn\'t work for me...Kurt Cobain, anyone?  How about Anthony Kiedis?  (Sure, you do too remember the Red Hot Chili Peppers.)

Sparkling clean.  Those are all good things.  I can see why it works for some folks even if not for me.  Different strokes.

I recommend you check it out if you haven't."", 'I\'m not a big yelp reviewer but I feel like my experience this morning is worth noting, for the safety of other potential customers. \nI am traveling from out of town and and am a bit nervous of being a potential carrier of covid 19 from my home town into areas that are less effected. At the same time, I don\'t want to pick this virus up from anyone along the way, because I would carry from one town to another. \nIn my travels, I have been pleasantly surprised by the overwhelming number of business that are doing their part to fight off this virus by wearing masks. \n\nI really really really don\'t want to wear a mask. But I do. Every time I go out in public and absolutely each time I walk into an enclosed space where there are other people. Again, I don\'t want to get you sick and, I don\'t want you to get me sick. It\'s an easy courtesy.\n\nWhen I walked into Caffeina this morning, I immediately noticed that 90% of the customers were not wearing masks. I thought, that\'s fine. Maybe the people of this town are similar to many other places iv been and they are more concerned with their ""freedoms"" than they are with stemming this disease which is killing WAY more people than it needs to. \nBut then I approached the counter to order my coffee and I found that not one of the baristas was wearing a mask. With our masks on, we ordered our drinks and then patiently waited. \nThe woman who came in after us was wearing a mask and after she ordered, she politely asked the barista ""excuse me, why aren\'t you guys wearing masks?""\nThe barista responded ""because we are not required to.""\n\nI was shocked. Traveling around the country, I have found that every business I go into; employees are always wearing masks. Sometimes they look like they don\'t want to but they do it. Either because it\'s the right thing to do, to help save lives or, because they have to.\n\nIn disbelief, I pulled out my phone and looked it up. Unless I misread my source, I seem to have read that it is in fact a requirement for any business in the city of Boise; for anyone in public, to wear masks. I disagree with the notion that we all must wear masks any time we are outside. But inside, in a place of business, it is an understandable essential. \n\nIt is the law in Boise and these baristas were breaking the law. But even if it was not required, it is dangerously absurd to take ""I am not required to wear a mask"" as an excuse to allow themselves to be exposed to me, who might cough in their faces, and by extension, they would be exposing themselves to others who come into their store.\n\nThe coffee at this pace was actually really good. And I got a bran muffin which was also good. \n\nBut the baristas who must have served 100 people before me and would probably go on to serve another 200 people after me, are thumbing their noses at safety precautions in the face of a global freaking pandemic. All because...... they don\'t want to wear masks.\n\nSeriously. Wear your freaking mask when you are at work dealing with food and cash exchanges!! You morons!!!

I would say Bombay Grill is probably one of the better options for Indian dining in Boise with a large group (where you\'ll still have plenty of elbow room). \n\nI typically order their Chicken Tikka Masala, which always comes out flavorful and delicious. They are generous with the heat, though. So, if you don\'t like things too spicy, I would ask for it  very mild. I made the mistake of asking for it ""mild to medium-ish"" (a little indecisive, I realize) and it came out tasting like an edible version of the sun on the 4th of July (ie: blazing hot). A testimony to their deliciousness? Even with mouth on fire, neck splotching, and forehead beginning to perspire (I\'m a baby), I couldn\'t stop from finishing it. \n\nBeyond their chicken tikka, I would say they nail all the staples. Their naan? Exactly perfect (ie: not too crispy, not too soft). Their basmati? Light and lovely perfection.\n\nTheir service is always spot on and their prices are reasonable considering their downtown locale. \n\nAll in all...I\'m a fan!\n\nGet to it!', ""We are very fortunate to have three great Indian restaurants in Boise and Bombay sets the bar very high. The food quality is always exceptional and the owners make the experience perfect. If you want to try a good selection of food to get a sense of what their quality is like or if you aren't sure what you like, try the lunch buffet first. \n\nBombay is located in the old Idanha hotel and the space is well past needing to be remodeled but it doesn't take away from the experience. This is good quality food in a casual atmosphere served by people who truly care about their customers. My daughter, girlfriend and I have been going since they opened and have virtually never had anything we didn't enjoy here.\n\nTheir butter chicken and mango chicken are two of the best Indian dishes in Boise and they also make a Dopiaza that is divine. I'm not a fan of the deserts but that is true of most traditional Indian desserts generally for me.\n\nOnce you discover Bombay you'll become a regular, the food and the service combined will bring you back again and again."", ""Why am I just now finding out about their lunch buffet?!? It is glorious. When my friends invited me out for Indian food, I was anticipating we would sit down, wait a few minutes, order, wait a few minutes, and then eat. What we experienced was far from that - we walked in, dropped our coats at our table, walked over to the buffet, filled our plates to our heart's content, sat down, ate, and then repeated the last four steps for good measure. ;)\n\nThe whole set up is genius - the restaurant is downtown (making it an ideal lunch spot), wait-time for food is pretty much non-existent, it's affordable considering what you get (around $12), and it is delicious!\n\nI tried a little bit of everything - the tikka masala, butter chicken, a vegetable curry, fried rice, chai tea, and these fried vegetable things. Oh. My. Gaaaaah. Let me tell you about the fried vegetables (I wish I could recall the actual name of the dish) - they were somethin' else, in a good way. Everything was good - but those were my favorite thing I tried.\n\nI cannot say too much regarding service seeing as it was a buffet. Our server did stop by several times and refill our waters/take away old plates - so I assume that if it were a normal dining experience service would be prompt!

We were originally meeting at Cafe Zupas (LOVE THEM) but they were packed with a line out the door. Being that we were both on our lunch hour we decided that wasn't the best place. I did notice San Francisco Sourdough Eatery and suggested that. We both love the city by the bay, we decided to check it out. Besides, it was bookmarked on my Yelp for quite a while. \n\nWhen we walked in, I noticed it was a cute and quiet area. I got a salad any my dining companion got a sandwich. We both were pleased with the food and the overall price wasn't bad at all. We will check it out again for sure."", ""Upon approaching San Francisco Sourdough, nestled in a strip mall on Emerald, one could easily mistake it for another run-of-the-mill sandwich shop in a community full of them. \n\nOne would indeed be mistaken.  \n\nI walked through their front doors when I smelled it..\n\n*sigh*\n\n...home.\n\nOk..ok...Boise, at this point, IS home.  But, I was raised in the Bay Area and lived there until I struck out and moved to good ol' B-town over a dozen years ago.  And, my people, there is nothing that transports me home like the smell of fresh baked sourdough.  I smell it, close my eyes, and there I am, sitting over a sourdough bread bowl filled with soup while listening to the sound of rain on pavement.\n\nAnd, my people, this is a smell one doesn't tend to stumble across here in Boise.  I've tried sourdough all over this valley and none of it comes close to what you get in San Francisco.  \n\nUntil now.\n\nHow is this possible?  I don't exactly know.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that their sourdough starter was cultivated IN the Bay Area.  From which, the dough is formed, frozen, and then delivered to San Francisco Sourdough Eatery here in Boise.  So, when you order your sandwich, your bread will be baked fresh and served as warm as you, wrapped in a blanket, in front of a wood stove, on a cold winter's eve.  Which, is to say, really quite comfortably warm, indeed.\n\nI had sampled several of their sandwiches previously and so I knew what I wanted:  The Pastrami with Coleslaw.  That is to say, the coleslaw is ON the sandwich.  Had I not tried it previously, I would never have thought to order it, but, it is amazing.  Amazing!  The coleslaw is just the right amount of creamy coolness, paired with the warm bread, warm pastrami, and melted Swiss.  This sandwich is a game changer.  \n\nI got the combo (they have 3 combo types:  sandwich with salad & drink, sandwich with soup & drink, sandwich with chips and drink) and splurged on a sugar cookie for dessert.  I didn't expect much from the cookie...but surprisingly delicious and worth the splurge!\n\nThe pastrami with coleslaw only comes in their large size, which was nice because, after having what felt like a hearty dinner, I still have half the sandwich that I shall be enjoying for lunch tomorrow!\n\nAhhh...comfort food.\n\nIs my affection for this place based on some sort of whimsical, sensory, culinary walk down memory lane?\n\nPerhaps.\n\nPerhaps you too, would enjoy a little culinary journey to the Bay without ever leaving Boise.\n\nI know I did.  And, will do so again.\n\nOften.\n\nGet to it!"", 'Delicious. I\'m talkin\' everything you want a sandwich to be. Fresh bread topped with high quality meats, cheeses, veggies and toppings.\n\nWe had a team lunch at work and decided to get food from here. I had only a few moments to browse their menu on mobile and decide, so I didn\'t get to reading all of the descriptions. I scanned the menu and saw the words ""Bacon and Avocado"" in the title of one sandwich, and it was settled. \n\nAll of my coworkers ordered half-size sandwiches, and I did as well...or so I thought. Apparently the Turkey Bacon Avocado is one of their specialties, and they only do full size sandwiches for their specialties. I wasn\'t mad about it. My plan at first was to save the second half for later...but who am I kidding? I ate every last bite of that sammie! It was delicious. The bread alone makes a trip here worth it. They also are generous with the amount of meat, cheese, bacon and avocado they topped this sammie with. The only thing I did not absolutely love was the mustard it came with. It was a bit too acidic for my liking. I think next time I\'d just skip on this sauce. Aside from that, this sandwich was a total hit in my opinion!\n\n**I\'ve only tried their food via takeout (which someone else picked up), so I have no remarks on the interior of the building or the service.**']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0

To find someone and/or a space to provide a proper cut is hard enough to find but add in that the barber uses a straight razor to attend to even the smallest of details and you have a fantastic cut, shave, and trim. The space is decorated like an authentic barbershop used to be and reminds me of a 1915-1920's look with fantastic eclectic artwork adorning the space with easy listing music and good conversation from the lead barber Chris. \n\nThe prices are affordable, and I walked out of there paying $10-$15 for my haircut with the tip included. Its really amazing because its about 25% and cheaper cost wise than most barbershops around. I've met some fantastic people that were waiting for a haircut while I was there and it gets even better when you can pass the time with great conversation with any of the barbers there. At Barbiere DeVino its more than a haircut its an experience and with the barbers that work there and its more like getting a haircut by a good friend than one of your more run of the mill barber locations. It truly is something from the past where quality service, professionalism, and atmosphere make that place so special.\n\n This will be my new barber hands down and I look forward to getting my haircut at this fine establishment. I support small business and it doesn't get any better than a barber who is a small business owner that can send it right back back into the local economy. I support Boise, Small Business Owners, and Great quality of service should be rewarded.

I was a bit hesitant since it did not have as many reviews as some of the other local places, but gave this place a chance. You have the option of walking in or making an appointment. I made an appointment and am glad I did because availability of the barbers is random and I wanted to get in and get out. The shop is located below ground and when you walk in you're greeted by alternative/punk/ska tunes on the sound system and a legitimate barbershop decor. Place is clean and I was immediately greeted by the staff and by Chris, my barber.\n\nChris was a super down-to-earth guy who kept me engage throughout the entire cut. I talked to him about what I was looking for and showed him a couple of pictures to make sure we were on the same page and went from there. Chris took his time and was very attentive to detail as he cut my hair. He was receptive when I asked him to fix a couple of things and he was very helpful in offering suggestions to how best to style my new cut.\n\nThis place is a no-nonsense type of barbershop with the occasional cursing, scantily clad women on calendars (which I did not care for, and may not be appropriate for younger customers) and uncensored music. This place definitely caters toward a younger crowd, but does not exclude other age groups. Haircuts are $20, with a neck shave thrown in.

After eating at Momo\'s in Meridian, I was really excited to try another places take on it. My mom got an Amazon Local deal for two lunch entrees at half the price (only $14, normally $28). Let me just say - the deal is not worth it at all. For the original price, I was expecting we\'d have a feast and be stuffed before getting halfway through it all. Instead what we each got were: 4 momo\'s (I got the vegetarian ones, and they were HALF the size of my mom\'s chicken ones...), a small portion of plain white rice, the chau chau, and a little dollop of chutney and a tomato sauce. We also got some nan on the side with the deal (it was about the size of one medium pita). For reference, we had asked what the lunch special was that day and for $10, we could have ordered the exact same thing, except we would have gotten a little salad and a flavored rice instead of plain. In my opinion, since the normal price of our option was $8 more, it should have been just as good as the lunch special, if not better. I might have been ok with the price/portions IF the food was amazing, but it was far from that.\n\nMy mom prefaced the meal with: ""I\'ve had one dish from here before and it was pretty good, but it needed salt"". This set me on edge because well, my mom NEVER adds salt to anything. Ever. Not even my wounds! So I knew the food would be a little bland. However, I had no idea just how bad it was going to be. The momo\'s had zero flavor. If I blind-taste tested them, I would think I was eating food from the future that had no flavor and was chalk full of the nutrients you needed to live, nothing more! Adding salt to them made them taste like salt. It didn\'t help to enhance any \'locked away\' flavors. The sauces to dip the momo\'s in had very little flavor to redeem them. I\'m no chutney expert, but I know what tastes good, and this didn\'t. I would not have even considered it a mint chutney because there was no trace of mint. The tomato sauce was better than the chutney, but it had some kind of bitter taste to it that just didn\'t sit right. The chau chau was the only somewhat decent dish, but I had to mix the white rice with it because the flavor was so strong (and no, I don\'t think that was the intention for including the rice). We even added salt to the nan. I\'ve never in my life added salt to bread that was already prepared. It seemed like there was no balance...everything was bland or had too much flavor.\n\nThe owner came across as a little pushy in trying to get us to order more than the food we got with our deal. I told him we might order more, depending on how our lunch was. After that experience, I would not eat there again, even for half price. Being completely honest...I wouldn\'t even eat the food from there if someone treated me to lunch, and I\'m all about free! Hate to be a naysayer, especially since I like to support local businesses, but I think food should be enjoyed and there was nothing appealing about this place.', 'Boise is blessed ten times over to have this absolute gem. Mount Everest Momo Cafe is the one of the only places is the city you can eat Nepalese/Himalayan food. The food is authentic, the service is outstanding and honestly, the interior is a little small and dark, but I love it. It mirrors how restaurants in Nepal typically look like. \n\nI went to Nepal as a student in college and grew to love their cuisine. I had major withdrawals when returning to Boise. My boyfriend-now-husby located Mount Everest for me and I had low expectations. I thought, ""Authentic Nepalese, in Boise?! No freaking way."" More like, holy cow I was blown away after eating. Now, I probably order take out 6-7 times a year. \n\nOn a recent visit, I began my meal with Yak Momo (steamed dumplings filled with ground yak, served with mild or spicy tomato sauce, $11.99). For those who\'ve never tried yak, I recommend it! If even to just say you\'ve tried it. It\'s much leaner than regular beef, and IMO, is more moist, sweet and tender. The Momo was steamed perfectly, I swear the entire thing nearly melted in my mouth. They were so juicy and delectable. This is a must order, for sure! \n\nFor my main course I ordered Lamb Masala (marinated lamb roasted in their special clay oven and cooked in curry sauce, $17.95). Do not let the price deter you. The owners use fresh lamb meat, and lamb tends to me a little more expensive. Also, it takes a little longer to cook so to be prepared to wait the extra 10 or so minutes it takes for the dish to be done. But I kid you not, it is absolutely 100% worth the wait. The lamb falls apart in your mouth with each bite and mixes in with the masala , bursting with flavor of the spices of the Himalayan cuisine. You want to eat this dish when it\'s fresh though because the lamb toughens up quick if you reheat it in the microwave (I learned the hard, sad way.). Also, you gotta get few pieces of Naan (tandoori baked soft and puffy bread, $3.00/piece). It\'s amazing either plain or dipped in masala/curry/vindaloo. \n\nOther highlights include fantastic service. On one visit we got the cutest little waitress who was super informative and attentive. The owner of the restaurant even came out to introduce himself and apologize for the long wait time. Above and beyond outstanding customer care. \n\nMount Everest Momo Cafe is no doubt one of my top 10 eateries in the Treasure Valley. I look forward to many more visits and take out orders in the coming years.', 'Owner won\'t accept Groupons and actually lies about it to your face. Not once but twice. If a proprietor of an establishment, especially a restaurant where you have mutual trust that your food won\'t contain anything harmful, won\'t even honor a $14 Groupon, refuses business and doesn\'t understand the very simple concept ""the customer is always right"" then good luck. I give the business 6 months max. Unfortunate because Boise needs more culturally diverse food. Note to owner Raj: don\'t try to reap the benefits of free publicity through Groupon and then turn away customers.

Pictures that move, bedazzled high heels in the bathroom, loud (yes, I'm using it as a noun), guacamole made at your table, sparkles, a rooftop patio, a suit of armor, fire, artwork painted on the ceiling, and Santa. \n\nIt's already decorated so...\nIt was my birthday (100 years ago) around Christmas time and I was having a small party. I knew this was the sort of place you had to try once (just to say you'd been) and it seemed like a good choice for a get together. \n\nThe food & drinks & service\nService and drinks were fine. No complaints at all. \nThe food was like a B movie but with a lot of special FX and make up, so at first glance it appeared to be a blockbuster. The food wasn't terrible, there was just a lot of flash and sizzle involved so it seemed fancier than it was. Which is kind of the point of Barbacoa. It's all just an illusion. \n\nSanta \nI pulled an Elf when I saw him walk in: SANTAAAA! IT'S SANTA!!!!!!!! He had a couple of elves with him and they sat at a table in the lounge area near our table. I got the waiter to find out what Santa liked to drink. Jager was the answer.

It was fantastic. \n\n3 stars \nAs much as I think this place is painfully overhyped, expensive, and has decor that looks like Las Vegas threw up, I have to give them props for my birthday party 100 years ago.

Not as good as we hoped it might be.  Still, not even very friendly server and guacamole maker could balance out the deficits.  And this we say to Happy Hour goers; beware of their ""two for one"" policy for libations.  \n\nIt is partly that policy, which we laughed about at first ""surprise"" but then thought not so funny, partly garish decor and partly dated menu at high prices that leaves us feeling lukewarm.  We wouldn\'t refuse to come back here if someone suggested it.  Neither would we suggest this as destination.\n\nVIBE\n""We would have thought this cool when we lived in the East Bay in the 1980\'s."", my husband said as we settled in at one of the step up booth tables in the dimly lit bar.  ""Yes"",  I said.  ""But that Medusa meets Lochness Monster sculpture evokes the bar from the first Star Wars movie.""\n\nNot that that is a bad thing.  But it is this thing.  If this was 30 years ago, we would have ""dug it"".  Different strokes in different times.  It seems laughably garish today.\n\nHAPPY HOUR UNHAPPY SURPRISE\nWe arrived about ten minutes to six.  Our plan was to have a cocktail, peruse the dinner menu and decide if we wanted to stay for dinner.  Yeeps whose opinions  I respect had given this just 2 or 3 star ratings so we figured we\'d approach with caution.\n\nOur friendly server told us there was a Happy Hour deal that ended at six o\'clock.  Two cocktails or glasses of wine for the price of one, she said.  Any wine or cocktail priced $15 or less qualified and both beverages had to be the same kind, she said.  \n\nSounded like a pretty good deal to us.\n\nThe server handed us an IPad to review  specialty cocktail menu and wine lists.  She said she would come back to take our order as the IPad was not for ordering just for reading the menu.  Seemed redundant to us since cocktail menus and wine list were on the table.   \n\nThis is indicative of the ""flash without function"" that seems hallmark for the space.  ""Oooh, Myrtle, look at this!  An Ipad."" \n\nMore goofiness masquerading as coolness that makes this place laughable. \n\nWe settled on top shelf Margaritas.  The drinks arrived in a tall glass with lots of ice and mixer and a straw.  Not the worst we\'ve ever had.  Not the best.  Still, at $10 each on the menu and in the ""two for one"" Happy Hour mode, we were feeling good about the bargain price of $5 a drink.  \n\nBut to our unhappy surprise, after nearly an hour had passed and we were nearing the bottom of our libations and getting ready to depart  our server arrived with two more drinks.  \n\nSpeechless for a moment (not often a state for me) I asked ""Umm?  We didn\'t order these"".  \n\nOur nice server said THIS was the ""two for one"" at Happy Hour.  You order one and you get a second one free after you drink the first one. \n\nOur first response was to laugh at being ""had"".  But being long past wanting to or being able to have two cocktails and navigate, this was lost on me as ""value"".  It seems a pretty sophomoric policy of the bar to over serve two drinks to folks who only want one.  Just sayin\'.  \n\nOur server said we weren\'t the first customers to feel ""had"" by the policy.  Seems to me ownership is shady to promote like this.  But it fit things being kind of ""off"" here all around.\n\nEATS\nLooking over the big, two sided, laminated dinner menu we decided we\'d pass (hot rock cooked steak, bbq chicken pasta...dated), order the table-side guacamole in the bar with our drink and move on.\n\nThe schtick of table-side guac seems a relic of 2000\'s.  Like flaming cherries jubilee table-side was for  the 1970\'s.  But Barbacoa sells a lot of guacamole this way.  As many as three guys with guac carts work on busy nights making up to 40 orders each we learned.  Shtick sells. (PS - There is a tip jar on the cart to tip the maker.)  Whether made table-side or in the kitchen doesn\'t matter as long as the guacamole is good.  And this, made and served in a molecajete, was good.  \n\nTHIS N THAT:\n\n1) PARKING:  Private lot and it was pretty full.  Goes to show, I guess, we are in the minority opinion about Barbacoa\'s mediocrity.\n\n2) ACCESSIBILITY:  Troublesome.  My Yelp friends who use wheelchairs will understand how dangerous it is to have wheelchair users have to travel behind parked cars against traffic in a parking lot  because the building owners violate the 24 year old Federal Civil Rights law and Idaho Code to put curb cuts at ADA parking locations  Also only one table at standard height in bar.  All other seating requires step up.  Dining room is step down on one side but ramp in on another.\n\n3) NEIGHBORS:  Boise Park owned lake and walking path right behind Barbacoa.  Fast food restaurant to front.', 'This restaurant will assault all of your senses and not in a good way. Barbacoa is the type of place that may promise appealing, but rather it is just appalling. What I\'ve deduced is that this is where the trashy, brassy, over 35, new money crowd in Boise hangs out. If that sounds appealing then go for it.\n\nThe overwrought design is a blend of, well EVERYTHING!  It\'s as if Salvador Dali threw up every cliché he had ever tried in one three dimensional space. There is the tunnel of wine bottles that you walk through to get to the lounge or dining area, the glass antler chandelier and the downright creepy Medusa like sculpture. All of the décor detracts from the perfectly lovely lake and mountain views from the window wall which runs along the eastern perimeter of the restaurant.\n \nThe scene is further diminished by the uncomfortably loud noise level throughout the space. One would think that the lounge would be where one would expect to find liveliness and laughter but this aural assault is continued throughout the entire space. The reason why it is so loud is because of the type of person or people who patronize Barbacoa. Typical profile of the clientele: must drive an entry level German luxury car on a lease, over coiffed and perfumed, first divorce just settled, shirt open to three buttons (men and women), excessive amounts of gold jewelry, and drunk to the point of sloppy obnoxiousness. Definitely a caricature, but oh so frighteningly real at the same time.  \n\nThe food at Barbacoa is also a bit of a mish mash and the menu is slightly schizophrenic. There is an excellent guacamole which is prepared table side. Then there is a tuna tartare \'tower\' which is served with a bizarre twist, mango sorbet. I didn\'t understand the point of the sorbet at all; I even followed the instructions of the food runner and let the sorbet melt into the tuna. It tasted like melted mango sorbet over tuna - neither ingredient worked to enhance the whole. Total gimmick IMO.\n\nSomeone at your table will certainly want to try the ""Hot Rock"" Filet ($34) which is a huge 10 oz.  cut that is served on an \'Argentina [sic] ironwood platter\' and with a small copper Turkish coffee pot of cognac sauce. You get to pick your side. When the entrée arrives at the table a member of the service team will pour a bit of the sauce over your steak which will then cause...you guessed it a flame. Oohh, ahhh!  Theatre of the absurd for adults - I guess this is what passes for fine dining at Barbacoa. The entrée presentation is problematic because of the hot rock since the meat continues cooking throughout the meal due to the residual heat of the rock and by the time you get to the middle of eating your steak it will be well done instead of the medium rare that you requested. This is too bad because the steak is decent.\n\nThere are other options besides a full roster of steaks including BBQ Cedar Plank Salmon, Idaho Trout, Chicken Pot Pie, Paella, and all kinds of pasta concoctions.  This menu is too broad and the choices seem convoluted - it needs focus in my opinion. How the hell is there chicken pot pie at a self-described Latin restaurant? Some editing in the number of choices would be helpful to both the kitchen and the diners.  \n\nBarbacoa\'s entrees and appetizers also suffer from too much of a good thing. The entrée ""When Pigs Fly"" ($27), aside from being just a dumb name, is a weird mish mash of a thick pork chop with chanterelle mushrooms and apples also comes with a small wood smoked quail and fig jam. Please I beg you, less is really more! \n\nIf all the above were all that were wrong with Barbacoa that would be enough to not recommend this place; however what makes this restaurant memorable is the regrettable service. The front desk staff is horribly rude and not at all welcoming!  The three women reminded me of the Gorgon women - with their overly sprayed coifs protruding from their heads like snakes and their forked tongues sticking out between their bleached fangs. These were not exemplars of a welcoming committee but rather a trio of college BFFs who felt put upon when asked a question about the menu, the restaurant, and yes even for a table. Unacceptable.\n\nThe service in the dining area is almost as aloof, but here it is the lack of experience rather than outright rudeness. The servers don\'t give an explanation of the menu and they read the specials without any enthusiasm. The front server, as opposed to the food runners, is what is lacking. The food arrives in a timely manner from the kitchen via the food runners; the wine, drinks, and check do not which is the responsibility of the primary server.\n\nBoise, you have much better places to spend your food dollars than at Barbacoa. I hope you aren\'t sucked in by the design and flamboyance, because you will be disappointed. If you are not, then I congratulate you on your ability to bypass the obvious shortcomings of this restaurant, I cannot.']",0.5,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,1.0,50.0

We were going to a comedy show at Liquid Laughs and had an hour to kill. We wanted to eat and with many yummy places to eat, we chose this place because it is more fast-food than a sit-down restaurant, which means we would make our show on time. \n\nThe inside is moderately decorated, which works. The decorations they have tells the story of their business and the food. They have Idaho decor, too. One of the neatest things was their soda machine-- nothing mainstream. There is no Pepsi or Coke-- rather different flavors that are made with no high fructose corn syrup. \n\nThe food was super good. I ordered a chicken skewer and they were out of chicken breasts. My options were then chicken thigh or pork-- I went with the pork, which was a good choice. \n\nMy dining companion got the pita nachos, which was divine. Nacho toppings with pita chips as opposed to tortillas, which works wonderfully. Another dining companion got a gyro (pronounced guy-row) with greek fries (regular fries seasoned with a greek blend). \n\nEveryone was super friendly and helpful. I enjoyed my meal. We will be back!', 'Pretty good spot for a quick lunch, though I found the menu hard to navigate. I came for a standard gyro sandwich but was given the choice between multiple styles (brunch-style, philly, italian...among others) and multiple options for meat. (I highly doubt the street vendors of Greece offer all these choices). I chose the standard Greek style called ""Athena,"" with lamb as the protein.\n\nThe staff was friendly, and after submitting my order and getting a number, I sat at a large, blue countertop that had an open-air view of the street (for that good people-watching on a busy Saturday).\n\nMy gyro was delicious and large. Good quality meat. Fries were great too. But for $10 for the sandwich ($13 for the combo with fries/drink) it seemed a little spendy - I can get the same thing in pricey CA for a few bucks less.  Still, I\'d go here again to try more items.', 'Came here for the soft opening and yum yum!  First, notice the metal art work of the State of Idaho and Greece...talked with a family member for a moment and was heartwarming to hear ""Idaho to Greece & Greece to Idaho"" connection. We talked to the father who is helping his son with the restaurant-he was extremely friendly even though very busy. \n\nSo tried the Traditional Pork Gyro (they were out of the lamb/beef combo) and husband tried the chicken...the first bite I thought...oh darn, kinda  dry...but the rest of the bites once got into the sauce-YUM- I truly could have drank a bowl of it! There was also crispy french fries on top & filled with savory meat, crisp onions, herbs & house made tzitki sauce (by the way, heard I\'ve been saying ""tzitki"" all wrong & it definitely sounded cooler in his accent!) And the pita/bread was soft and delicious. \n\nWe also tried the The Village Salad...bright and fresh. Honestly at first I thought how can I eat a bowl of bell peppers? But it too, was savory and delicious (and more than just bell peppers) and the dressing was zippy and fresh. \n\nA plate of flat bread was brought out with the Fava Bean Dip/spread (much like hummus) and to my surprise a whipped Feta w/a bit of jalepeno (forgot the name of it) with maybe a touch of lemon (something citrusy) that gave it a bit of sunshine. \n\nNext....baklava sticks or think little baklava egg rolls! It was getting pretty loud now so hard to hear but think he may have said they may not serve them this way so I made sure to voice that the ""stick"" made it much easier to eat than traditional baklava and goes right along with ""street food"" flair. It had a deep cinnamon flavor that was very good.\n\nTHEN...they had Boise made BuckSnort canned root & ginger beer sodas. They also had Stubborn Brand fountain sodas with no high fructose corn syrup or artificial sweeteners. The black cherry soda and the lemon-berry acai was very refreshing. They also had beers on tap. \n\nWe are excited to come back when it officially opens in the next week or so and try some more goodness!

Others, like blueberry crumble and apple and chocolate are perhaps less regional and every bit as delicious.\n\nI\'m a pie fanatic, my Yelp profile even lists home baked pie as one of the things I LOVE, so I was delighted to find Bridgette and Terrance McAbee\'s pie shop and eatery.  Eatery being the piece some folks may not know about. I didn\'t until I went in to find they also have savory food here too like quiche, homemade soups like butternut squash or green chile or lemon chicken orzo, creative sandwiches, shepherd\'s pies and chicken pot pies.\n\nTHE EATS & PRICES: If you think real pie comes from one of the grocery store bakeries or Costco, think again.  Boise Pie Company pies are the real deal using all fresh ingredients and scratch made.  I\'m hard pressed to think of another retailer in the Boise area who specializes in home baked pies like these, both as whole pies and by the slice.  Prices vary based on the kind of pie, but I think they are roughly $4.00 - $4.50 / slice or about $18.00 / pie.  And a really great deal is any three slices of pie as sampler for only $11.00.\n\nScratch made savory eats are also so reasonably priced as in a bowl of homemade soup for only $5.00 or a special this week of cheddar chive biscuit \'sandwich\' with pimiento cheese, jalapeño pineapple jam, smoked honey ham, and  arugula and served with a cup of soup for only $8.95.\n\nTHE WHOLE PIES:  feed six generously and are big enough to cut into eight pieces for more restrained eaters or to share with others sipping vino at a local winery.  (Apple pie is a good pairing with some wines.  I kid you not.  And strangers become friends eating pie and drinking wine together.)   But I\'m thinking for my birthday this year, when calories don\'t apply, I might just eat an entire Key Lime pie all by myself.  You think I\'m kidding.\n\nTHE SPACE:  is light and bright and sparkling clean with décor that is both crisp, seafoam green and vanilla white and licorice black combined walls and ceiling details, and rustic with a driftwood / barnwood look trim at the order counter.\n\nTHE DRILL: is order at the counter to wait to take out, or after ordering for eat in take a seat and they will deliver to your table.  Tthe shop has seating at both high tables and standard height tables.  \n\nWERE I THE QUEEN:  I\'d wave my scepter and bid them move to a location closer to my neighborhood in Eagle so I could pop in more often.  Then again, were that true, I\'d need to start a Go Fund Me account for a larger size wardrobe.\n\nTHIS N THAT:\n\n1) Location is a bit out of the way, next to CHF resale consignment store and LaZBoy furniture, but that has advantages too in that there is a parking lot with ample parking.\n\n2) Accessibility is good with ADA parking in the lot and an access ramp alongside the stairs to this elevated location.  Standard height table seating available.  Ample floor space. \n\n3) I don\'t now if they have a loo, in neither visit was I in need of asking.\n\n4) Closed Sunday and Monday.', 'I can be pretty fastidious when it comes to restaurants & desserts worth suggesting to friends. Combine that with the fact that you can count on one hand the number of good places to get a decent pie in the Boise valley area, (That isn\'t another boring production-line pumpkin pie from Costco) I was pleased to hear the Boise Pie Co. had just opened up (10/31) on Orchard street & they had a variety of pies to choose from just in time for Thanksgiving.\n\nNow, as any good husband or boyfriend knows, when your wife or girlfriend is having one of those weeks..and has been dropping hints that\'s she\'s been craving a slice of her favorite type of pie, (in this case Apple)...a smart man will search high and low to find her favorite pie & surprise her with it - earning some points along the way.  Enter the Boise Pie Company!  \n\nStaff & Store\nWhen I called and spoke to Terrance on the phone about what they had, he was very polite and professional and was patient with me asking questions about their different deserts, and was able to tell me exactly what they had available, from Pumpkin Pies, to Pecan Pies, Chess Pie to Peanut Butter Pie, 3-Berry Pies, to Apple Pie and Key Lime Pie.\n\nI arrived at the new store location which is on the left side of the La-Z-Boy Building on 1216 N. Orchard Street, and to the right of Idaho Camera. The store is clean & cozy and has a rustic, yet quaint southern style spin on soups, sandwiches and of course Pies! They display their pies inside a glass case of emotion because even though you can see them, trying to formulate complete sentences while deciding how many you want can cause internal trauma and confusion. The struggle is real.\n\nI was happily greeted by Bridgette and Terrance who make the magic happen with each one of their hand-crafted pies, each of which have a unique pinch of Unicorn and fairy dust added to the recipe which makes them 10 times more addictive than crack. Bridgette was very friendly and personable, and you can tell has a passion for baking these pies and desserts. She effortlessly explained the different key ingredients in each of the pies, making each one more difficult to choose from the last.\n\nThere are a few tables if you want to stop in for lunch or need a dessert to get you through the day or simply need a table to lie down on after your pie-educed food coma sets-in. They sell their branded thermos, T-shirts, hats & items in the store too. I suggested they sell a fake moustache and sunglass kit for when you are walking out of there with 7 pies and see your neighbor Betty from the PTA committee & want to make sure she doesn\'t recognize and secretly judge you. The parking lot has plenty of room, which is great if you go and unexpectedly eat a full pie by yourself and need to sleep it off in your car in the lot. The store is also in a great location if you need to grab a pie and hop on the freeway on your way to meet and try to impress your new girlfriends mother as something you just whipped up and try to pass off as your own. (psst...It won\'t work)\n\nThe PIES!\nI wasn\'t sure what to expect when I got to the store, but I was assured by Bridgette that I could take my time deciding, but they wouldn\'t allow camp-outs inside the store as I suggested.  After I carefully compared my notes between each pie, and after finally being told I was being cut-off for what I assumed was endless samples, I had to make my decision! Ok, they didn\'t really give out endless samples, I made that part up...and I already knew what my girlfriend wanted, which was one of their Apple pies, but my point is the decision was still difficult! So it was at that moment as she was boxing up this Apple Pie which looked like it was sent from Heaven, that I made the horrible mistake of telling her my favorite pie was actually Key Lime pie. No sooner had the words left my mouth that I realized the gravity of my mistake, as Bridgette smiled & said ""Actually, I just took a Key Lime pie out of the oven in the back!""  All I could do was blankly stare for what felt like an eternity as my brain scrambled to find the ""Maybe next time"" phrase... I felt like that kid Ralphie from the movie ""Christmas Story"" when he yelled.. ""Ohh Fuddggee"".  And like him, there was no turning back for me. I was doomed. Before I knew it, and after hearing that Key Lime Pie was one of Bridgette\'s specialties, having the Lime Juice specially imported from miniature baby limes in Florida, I just blurted out the words ""YEAH I\'LL TAKE THAT ONE TOO!""  without hesitation.  It was like she KNEW it was my weakness, and I was powerless against the Key Lime Pie.\n\nI\'m out of room on this review, but in closing, I will tell you these pies were hands down some of the best I\'ve ever had. And the Key Lime Pie you HAVE to taste to believe. Especially with their homemade whip crème. To quote my girl the next day at lunch via text ""This pie is Freaking amazing!"" Trust me when I say just go and get one. I\'m already ordering more for Thanksgiving!']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

Or at least, eat alone. In sweet, sweet silence. \n\nI had a night off so I used my trusty Yelp app to search ""foodie"" and ""new"" and I got turned on to Taste Asian Fusion. I read a couple reviews, looked at the stunning photos and off I went on a Wednesday!\n\nOverall, my experience was nice. The staff was extremely quick and I was seated where I wanted and given menus. I don\'t normally order fancy pants drinks, but the pictures just looked so darn pretty. So I ordered a ""Spring Rain"" Saketini. I definitely could only drink one as it was a bit on the sweeter side. But it had a hint of sour and that refreshing pink color made it so fun. \n\nI started with the Gyoza. Delicious! The potsticker was pan seared and moderately crisp. The inside was moist and full of flavor. I like a really crisp potsticker, so I would make a few changes. They served it on top of some delicious sweet chili sauce, but it made the Gyoza a bit stoggy. I\'d serve that on the side, or nestle the Gyoza on top of some garnish. They also included some very thinly shredded carrots. These tasted nice, but again, a bit soggy. Maybe they could have fried them and added on top? Or maybe some crushed peanuts would have been nice. I was just missing some crunch. \n\nI finished my meal with the pho. This was pretty disappointing. I\'m used to pho that is absolutely bursting with flavor and has that DEEP bone broth goodness. I needed to add quite a bit of hot sauce and (I think) hoisin sauce to pump up the flavor. The beef slices were pretty tough and the meatballs were not my favorite. They had a really tight texture...almost like a boiled sausage. The noodles were alright but not amazing. I should have asked for a recommendation on my entree. I won\'t be getting that again. \n\nI don\'t know how much this is Asian ""Fusion"" as it is more just a varied menu with different Asian food options. There were Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese and Indian foods represented on the menu. But as far as I could tell, none of those foods were ""fused"" together. \n\nOverall, it was a welcomed dining experience. A few modifications and I think this place could be 5 star.', 'We went for dinner tonight, Sat night. This is the first restaurant I have been to in the Treasure Valley with Malaysian flavors. We chose to eat at the bar, which has a nice ambiance, though we suggested they add a TV for sports. We started with the Shu Mai appetizer and if you ever tried to have dim sum here, you know its frozen at other places. This is made from scratch. For dinner we shared their take on Mussaman Beef, which was a deconstructed version using a giant short rib over a bed of carrots, potato, onion and peanut curry sauce. We also had pork lovers dish and the pork belly was En Pointe, though i think next time I would get a dish that was only pork belly. The dessert was a warm butter cake with (mango ?) sauce ice cream.  They do not have a liquor license (yet), but they make mixed drinks using Sake and they have beer and wine. The drink I chose had sake, berry syrup, seltzer and was garnished with berries and rosemary, recommended by the bartender. It was light, sweet and refreshing. This is a new restaurant and since they are still developing their menu it is not posted online. While we were there, a couple came in, looked at the menu and walked out. This saddens me but also I realize that these are dishes that people here are unfamiliar with. So, I guess this review is mostly for the people commenting on Facebook foodie pages about not having ""real"" Asian food in treasure valley (as compared to California, etc) but also for people who want to experience something new. These dishes will not continue to be offered if no market exists for them here. So I implore you foodies to try it out! Ensure that the market for food like this exists here!  And who knows, someday we could have a Oaxacan restaurant or a Mexican restaurant that serves Enoconcado with slow cooked chicken and not chewy freezer burned disgustingness covered in sauce, but I digress....And, while I am at it, I would like to make some suggestions to the owner of Taste for some other dishes I have been missing. How about some Nasi Lemak with Sambal Prawns, Beef Rangoon or Roti Pratha with Curry sauce as an appetizer? I wish you the best of luck and I hope you will be able to continue to offer dishes unique to this valley.', ""This place is great! I ordered the generals chicken.  It was tasty but I think I should have ordered something else.  The chicken was deep fried and the sauce was really strong! Once I mixed the sauce in good, it was delicious. But I'm sure I want to come back and try something else that isn't deep fried.  The place is really nice.  Classy and cute.  The staff was friendly.  Price was reasonable.

The restaurant reviews were originally posted on the Modern Hotel Yelp page but in June 2019 looks like owners set up a separate Yelp page for the Modern Bar and Restaurant.  Among my hubby\'s and my top 3 favorites of all eateries in Boise and after umpteen visits over the last 6 years we easily opine 5 stars for it - see review posted at that Yelp page - https://www.yelp.com/biz/modern-bar-and-restaurant-boise-3.\n\nBut we stay-cationed at the Modern Hotel with a \'one time is enough\' experience.  I imagine that had as much to do with our demographic as with the hotel because the Modern Hotel consistently wins ""Best of Boise"" ratings from a local alternative newspaper in a yearly contest and gets high mention in travel publications.  So this is likely one of those issues where ""it\'s not you, it\'s me"" for relationship fit.  We are in the ""Boomer"" demographic - but clearly adventurous enough to appreciate the Modern Bar and Restaurant as regular diners and imbibers there, - and the hotel may better suit a younger age group.\n\nIn fact, when we shared with neighbors of about our age who are more hip and well traveled than we that we were planning \'staycation\' at the Modern they urged us to reconsider based on their disappointing experience. ""We shoulda listened to you!"", I messaged her early on the evening of our stay.\n\nSo I share here for setting expectations.  Different strokes for different folks.  There is much to commend the Modern Hotel but also things that might not work so well.  An out of state traveler-guest who struck up a conversation with me in the parking lot and who was about my age said he and his wife were surprised to find this hotel that was highly touted by a college age relative to be so not a fit for them.  But, he said, ""It\'s a hell of a good restaurant here - what a find!""  Yes, indeed.  \n\nLOCATION:  The Linen District is far enough from downtown to be out of the chaos but close enough to provide easy access to everything.   Fun Basque wine bar and eatery Txikiteo, same owners as this, is just a couple of blocks walk away.  But there is a goodly amount of noise in the rooms, either from the nighttime \'hot-rod cruising\' or from the revelers on the bar patio in the courtyard some of the rooms face.  For some that is no worries.  For others, now you know.  The hotel provides ear plugs on request.\n\nPROPERTY:  Two stores, no elevator.  Some first floor rooms can be accessed from hall and from outside door.  Many rooms accessed only via outside door.  Nice exterior patio with tables for hotel and restaurant guests.  There is a small parking lot in front which is a good thing.  \n\nROOMS:  Comfy beds but the low slung chair in the room is not the easiest to get in and out of for guests of a certain age.  If you\'re planning on staying more than overnight the closet space is uber-limited - a \'hang \'em horizantal\' cabinet for clothes.  Large desk-top with TV above it.  Wi-fi was not working for sign in and we had to go to the front desk for a work around. (See Service)  Walls are thin, as the saying goes, and your neighbors can be heard. \n\nBATHS: Spacious step-in doorless shower with two heads and a small window thru which one can gaze into the room or vice versa.  I imagine all that is much fun for some but our issues with the bathroom were practical functional ones:  the tiny pedestal sink lacked any counter space, the door into the bathroom from the bedroom was only about 23"" clear width (I\'m size 2, my hubby is 32 waist - not big people but this \'skinny door\' felt just odd) and had obscure glass through which one could see with the light on in the loo and the commode was placed directly along the inside of wall that paralleled the bed so...  We\'ve been married nearly 40 years but for a couple newer in acquaintance this might not be such a \'romantic\' set up.  \n\nEXTRAS:  Free continental breakfast Mon - Fri for hotel guests.  Not on Sat & Sun given brunch is served 8 - 2.  (Highly recommend the unique brunch!)  We didn\'t know free breakfast wasn\'t served on Saturday until after check in on Friday night when a server in the restaurant at dinner told us.  Now you know too.\n\nSERVICE:  The young woman who helped us book our staycation night was so helpful.  In the dozens of times we\'ve been through the hotel lobby on our way to or from the restaurant, always friendly folks.   Alas, on the night of our visit when we couldn\'t connect to wi-fi and had to go the lobby where the guy on duty had to use an employee password on our phones to make wi-fi work, he was in constipated service mode showing his frustration on that issue and answering a question we asked about the hotel.  Everyone can have a bad day.\n\nACCESSIBILITY:  ADA parking in lot.  Level in at lobby.  Didn\'t check for ADA rooms.', ""The Modern Bar & Restaurant - four stars.\nThe Modern Hotel - three stars.\n\nOk, the hotel:\n\nYou can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. This hotel (a former Motel 6) is still a concrete Motel 6 dressed up. The bed was comfy, as were the pillows, so price depending, this is a great deal. I believe they offer complimentary cruiser bikes and downtown Boise is literally a 5-7 minute walk, so location wise it's also on point.\n\nBut, I found the rooms sad. No art adorned walls, digital television with limited channels, not a lot of natural light and if I did decide to leave the curtains open, the entire street would see me. Walls were thin, I could hear pretty much any noise outside, including the maids vacuuming at 9am and the doors didn't close well, but the internet was strong.\n\nThe complimentary breakfast highlight was the coffee and fresh juice. Food wise it was also a little sad: Chobani yogurt and meh looking bagels with butter, a block of cream cheese or jam. Add some fresh fruit into the mix and then we'd be talking.\n____________________\n\nThe restaurant was good, albeit a tad bit over priced. Those corn fritters, tho. They were almost like corn beignets. So good, that we had them two nights in a row. My dining companion enjoyed her gnocchi and the lamb kofta was good, but again the price didn't quite live up to the hype. Drinks were nice and strong and a fairly local and inexpensive beer list.\n\nOverall, not a bad option in Boise especially when I'm not aware of the competition. I would stay here again if options were limited."", 'Reading ""hipster hotspot"" descriptions in media coverage for The Modern, even terms like ""swanky"", I wondered if my husband and I might not be welcome.  We are for sure not that demographic.  But we are food centric travelers, The Modern was his discovery in planning a Boise relocation tripe was insistent we give it a go based on food reviews which sounded like just the fit for us.  Good thing I said OK!   Because the best food enjoyed during a week in Boise came from The Modern\'s tiny kitchen built into one of the former guest rooms of the Hotel which is a re-imagined Travel Lodge.  (That alone suggests ""non-swanky"", don\'t you think?)  We found ""all people are welcome"" vibe, friendly service, inventive cocktails, delicious food and good value.  We loved it.\n\nThis is an equally friendly gathering place as happy hour for grown ups of all ages, including those of us whose 50\'s are in the rear view mirror as well as those who are just started on the road of their 20\'s. Maybe I\'d have felt less intimated going in if I\'d checked the Modern\'s website first for what the owners have to say.  I share their comments below in the event it helps others of the ""not so hipster"" set go in the door.  Noli timere, Boomers! \n\n""...we envisioned a grown up space with great cocktails...friendly but stylish sort of establishment with knowledgeable bartenders, new music and good wine...small and intimate...Our kitchen provides our guests with simple, elegant bar food...showcase produce and meats grown by local farmers and ranchers...When the weather is fine...guests socialize on our outdoor patio and listen to local music while enjoying the best food and drink Boise has to offer.""\n\nHere is what you\'ll have a chance to enjoy:\n\nMENU / FOOD:  Given the former Travel Lodge origination, we surmise the Bar (adjacent to the Hotel\'s registration office) may have once been meeting room in a former life.  As our server went in and out the exterior door to return with food we learned the kitchen was built into one of the former ground floor guest rooms. \n\nThe chef, a California Culinary Academy graduate, has designed a small and creative menu ranging from appetizers through entrees and dessert (in price range of roughly $5 - $15) using seasonal and  locally sourced ingredients.  Local sources are printed on the menu and that is something my hubby and I appreciate as farm-to-fork focused eaters. \n\nWe started with chile spiced nuts ($5) to share with cocktails.  With our wine order, we moved to lamb meatballs in red wine demiglace from the appetizer menu ($10); three nice sized meatballs nestled in the most delicious sauce came with crostini to sop up every drop.  We also shared an entree of tender gnocchi with fresh chard, cherry tomatoes and garlic ($13).  There is finesse in the preparation of each dish. \n\nThere are options here for vegetarians as well as omnivores.\n\nSERVICE: Our server knew the menu to answer our questions, provided share plates with our orders and paced the plates perfectly to allow us to linger as we wanted to do but not to have to wait.   So nicely done. \n\nLIBATIONS:  Happy hour here, 4p tp 7p, is a great deal with a couple of the inventive house specialty cocktails only six bucks during that time and a buck off wine.  \n\nI started with a Sanlucar cocktail ($6) which combined tequila, grapefruit juice and Aperol and also had added a bit of salt to balance.  Served up in a coupe glass it was just a bit bitter, as anticipated from the ingredients, and a fun choice.  My husband chose a Manhattan-like specialty called Boulevardier ($6) of rye, sweet vermouth and campari.   Served in a highball glass with a single large ""rock"" of ice to avoid watering down the cocktail.   \n\nCocktails were moderate in size, that is a good thing, to leave us capacity for vino.  The wine list by the glass was small but thoughtfully crafted and fairly priced.  With our food I had a prosecco ($6) and he chose an Italian red ($6.50).  Both pours were generous. \n\nVALUE:  Total @ $53 before tax, for a couple of hours of enjoying the space and friendly service along with cocktails, wine and food for two.  A great value. \n\nTHIS N THAT:\n\n1) PARKING:  Lot is small and I couldn\'t identify where overflow parking might go.\n\n2) ACCESSIBILITY:  Level in and throughout, although tightly spaced tables on patio may make entry there near impossible for wheelchair users. (Like me on this visit.)  Accessible parking in the lot.  High perch seating only at bar with standard height tables and chairs adjacent. \n\n3) OUTSIDE SEATING:  Available on a patio one travels to get from the parking lot to the Bar entry,  Too much wind and too many (many many) flies on the September evening of our visit for us to choose this.  But we noticed others braving both those things to sit outdoors.']",0.5714285714285714,0.0,0.0,0.2857142857142857,0.14285714285714285,1.0,30.0

Put down the @*#$% phone."" \n\nUse your imagination to fill in the @*#$%. \n\nI\'m with them on that. Pet peeve to have people carry on a phone conversation when placing an order like this. Those nice guys behind the counter deserve the respect of full attention.\n\nI digress.\n\nAside from the polite sign, the rest here is all New Yawk pizzeria. My Italian-American-Brooklyn-Born-And-Raised hubby approved. A slice is foldable to eat it; his true test of authentic New York pizza. Good crust, which is truly the thing for pizza, and just enough but not too much sauce and cheese to cover it up. Not to mention a big shaker of pepperoncino on the counter. \n\nThe ambiance is just right; red-white-green floors (quick, what are the colors of the Italian flag) and New York photos and sports memorabilia on the walls (although too much Mets and not enough Yankees in my hubby\'s not so humble baseball opinion), linoleum tables and basic chairs. Most important, the aroma is all pizza when you walk in the door.\n\nOrdering is easy, by the slice ($2.50 or less) from several pies they have at the counter, or a whole pizza. The latter comes in two sizes (18"" and 20"") and in three ""bases"", Cheese (starting at $13), Cheese and Basil (starting at $13.50) and White (starting at $14). Toppings are a buck each and range from traditional (think peppers and onions) to those that make my husband cringe (think Canadian bacon and pineapple). \n\nFor my two bits, the best is Cheese and Basil, which is pretty perfect by itself, or with fresh tomatoes added for a quasi Margherite. \n\nThey also have salads, garlic bread and stromboli. But why would you when the pizza is so darned good?\n\nTo go orders happily filled.\n\nNo delivery.\n\nTHIS N THAT:\n\n1) PARKING: Private lot.\n\n2) ACCESSIBILITY: Accessible parking in lot.

I really like NY Pizza in which you need to fold it over to eat it.  I love the fact that you can order a slice of pizza or order a whole fresh pie.  I am really picky about having hot fresh pizza so if you are like me, I recommend ordering a new pizza from scratch or getting your reheated slice really well done.  It is as close as you can get to a fresh pizza by asking them to cook it longer in the oven for you.  They have garlic salt shakers and it actually makes the pizza taste great, just my opinion.  I've been to this one and their downtown location, both are really good."", 'Sadly, Guido\'s has a falling star...\n\n...because there\'s New York style thin crust pizza (defined as: crisp on the bottom with about a 1/8th an inch thickness of dough plus a layer of cheese and sauce that\'s not caked on but at least identifiable as a layer) and then there\'s ""I can practically see right through this!"" Unfortunately, I experienced the latter on my latest visit to Guido\'s. And I kid you not! There were several slices that were literally (proper use of the word, ""literally,"" by the way) translucent. \n\nFurthermore, I think that the cheese, sauce, and toppings on my pie were afraid that they might fall off, because they stayed at least 3 inches away from the edge, all around.\n\nLook, I don\'t know if this is an attempt to skimp for the sake of saving money from a business owner\'s perspective or if the new kid just wasn\'t properly trained on how to make a pie.\n\nEither way, if you\'re a regular at Guido\'s, and you\'re reading this, please let me know if you think this was just an off night or if you\'ve been experiencing the same issues.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0

They happily took our reservations, even though, at first, I didn't have a fixed number for them.  I had initially made reservations for 6 but warned it could grow to 12.  I called back the day before to say it looked like we'd be closer to 12 than 6.  And, good thing I did because we ended up with 12 (possibly 13?) attendees.  Kyoto was friendly and helpful throughout the reservation process and not the least bit impatient with the changing numbers.  I arrived early to make sure everything was set.   Kyoto had a plan in place and were completely prepared for our arrival.  Having planned several group outings in the past, I can say restaurants are not always so on the ball.  Kyoto really deserves recognition for having been so thoughtfully prepared for our arrival.\n\nNow, part of my motivation for planning the UYE (other than obviously the desire to meet all the fabulous yelpers!) was to get a little more sushi-proficient.

All that attended were very generous with their wealth of sushi knowledge.\n\nSo, having said that, I am certainly not a sushi expert.  I did try some of the Co-op's offerings leading up to our visit here, as well as Trader Joe's, and a couple bites at Mai Thai.  I will say this:  Of all the sushi I've tried, Kyoto's was the best.  We began with Miso soup, which was scrumptious.  Boise Yelper Kim R., then shared her octopus salad with us.  I have never tried octopus salad before and was completely surprised at it's deliciousness.  I guess I was expecting it to be kind of chewy--but it was not in the least.  Fellow yelper, Shelle M and I, each ordered a roll and then shared with each other so that we could both try more than one roll.  I ordered the Austin roll and she the Ernie (I think?).  Both were out of this world.  They were both ample and seriously delish.  I also tried a bite of hokkigai nigiri which was amazing (another one I was a little tentative about but needn't have been!).  And, some sort of egg that was the star of the show for me--sweet, light, and lovely.\n\nThe service was a little spotty as we did have a snafu with on one of the checks (WAY overcharged).  The server didn't budge on the amount while we were there.  But, I was happy to learn that management DID make it right and refund her the amount she was overcharged.  Some in our party ordered hot food and Ben, our chef, was entertaining on the grill.  He put on quite a show and was funny to boot.  \n\nOverall, great sushi, and a great time with fellow yelpers!  I will definitely be back!  I may even get my main dining companion to give sushi another try at Kyoto!  They may just convert him to a sushi enthusiast!  Fingers crossed!\n\nGet to it!"", 'Ok, let\'s set something straight right now, a 5-star restaurant is something like The Top of the Mark in San Francisco or something like that. This is NOT a 5-star despite what ""Ronnie"" wants you to believe. Maybe ""Ronnie"" is an Idaho native and one thing\'s for sure, their standards are *very* low.\nOK about the restaurant: This place is VERY popular with the local crowd, probably because of the hibachi show (Think Benihana). I believe the joint used to be a Shakey\'s as can be seen carved into the original concrete. The interior, if you look closely, is all worn and beat up with massive water stains in the ceiling tiles especially over the sushi bar. (a *tiny* sushi bar) The main tepanyaki (flat grill and show) prepared food is decent and well priced during lunch. (rice and meats) The side dishes fall well below the mark. Salad is western style w/croutons, small and not very tasty. They also serve a blah onion soup, probably catering to western tastes, but not very Japanese. Prices go up by around 50% at dinner so be prepared to get socked.\nThe sushi side of things was a huge disappointment. The owner was not there, instead his wife was doing the slicing and dicing. Here they give you low quality miso soup. Our sushi was the biggest let-down. We got very tiny, paper thin (or shoji-thin!) pieces, the kind you\'d expect at the $1.00 sushi boat place. Except these cost $4.00! That could only be categorized as a rip-off in my book. The fish was OK, and they did have a tasty No. 9 Kyoto roll, (shrimp, avocado, tobiko) but that didn\'t make up for their stingy portions. Also, they didn\'t serve any tea, guess you gotta ask for it or pay for it. If you want the grill tepanyaki show, a better place to go might be Ichiban. The best sushi place in town still remains Shige\'s.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

Detailed stories about a resident cat, executions, riots, fires, and a couple of unscrupulous wardens over the years added to the intrigue. \n\nWhen this prison closed in 1973 there were still  several cells without a toilet, many prisoners were still using a bucket as a bathroom when it closed. \n\nIn summary I'm really glad we took this tour, as it did not disappoint. I found it extremely interesting, and well worth a stop. Additionally at certain times of the year they offer overnight tours which would add to the experience, I hope to try it some time in the future."", ""A hundred years ago, it started off as a jail for males only, then had to make an adjustment as a final count of 222 debauched women eventually came into the picture. A complex of buildings made of architectually interesting carvings and grey sandstone walls are reminders of the stark difference in jail life of the 1800 and 1900's to today's quarters.  Not that I would know....thankfully.\n\nYou can take a guided tour, or simply walk the grounds at your own pace, reading the signs along the way.  The best place to start is with the short historical video that runs about every 20 minutes in the main building.  The main entry has a few rooms staged to see what prison life was like from both viewpoints (prisoner and enforcer), and a roomful of artifacts in large glass cases.\n\nThe air feels thick as you pass through many areas.  Imagine the associations to crime and violence and inhumane, the depressing punishments given (sometimes too harsh for the crime committed). There is still the evidence of the raging flames that licked the cafeteria and kitchen building as a result of the riot of 1973 that ultimately decided the fate of this spector of a facility.  That entire grey stone building is now nothing more than a roofless, hollow shell with a visible depressing underground network of tiny rooms below the main floor that were used for food prep, storage, and who knows what. \n\nOne old, still intact building is devoted solely to the history of tattoos and their significance to prison life. Large photos of notable inmates and their stories are posted on the walls. Quite fascinating.\n\nAnother building is set aside for a vast gun collection, old military weaponry and displays to depict life in the trenches of WWI. \n\nThe trap doors covering holes in the ground and narrow dark cells used as tortuous solitary confinement chambers can be seen as you wander the grounds.  Some buildings that were open for viewing include the creepy, multi-leveled cell blocks for the masses, with rusty doors and peeling institutional paint. I cannot imagine enduring the extreme weather conditions and lack of significant protection.\n\nThe pathways are frequently cracked, uneven, and difficult to maneuver for those with physical disabilities, yet in contrast, some of the grounds have been cheerfully landscaped with green grass and flowers, a juxtaposition of the underlying morose tone.\n\nPlaying with your imagination, it is haunted in my opinion.  It took a hundred years until it finally closed its doors to this chapter in Idaho history.  Interesting place to visit.  But I sure wouldn't want to live there."", 'FUN!

I put my biggest hoop earrings on and headed over with Indy for the first time. Tango\'s does not look like much. It\'s a small unimpressive building with various flags from Latin American countries draped like curtains at the windows. I love places like this, it doesn\'t need to be fancy and you know it\'s going to be good. \n\nFact: You already love empanadas~\nEmpanadas are basically like samosas, sambusas, pierogis, piroshkis, hand pies, or hot pockets. I\'ve eaten all of those, they all have the same concept, different fillings and variations of flaky crust. It\'s comfort food and almost every country/culture has something similar. There are many empanadas to choose from, vegetarian, meat, breakfast, dessert, cheesy, there is something for everyone.\n\nWhen you empanada, you\'re family~\nYou order at the counter and they call your number when your food is ready. Every single person who walks in the door is treated as family. Not like family, as family. It\'s a cultural thing, and I felt that. One step through the door and I thought ""I\'m home. I\'m finally home.""\n\nCan\'t go wrong~\nIndy and I ordered the Chinese (basically like spring roll type filling), the Salteña (ground beef, potatoes, onions, eggs), and of course for dessert the Cocco (dulce de leche with coconut). They were all fantastic and all the ingredients were correctly proportioned. The prices are affordable, around 2.50-3.00 per empanada. \n\nYou can find me in stretchy pants from now on~\nTango\'s is an instant favorite. I am canceling my gym membership,  donating my skinny jeans, and kissing my svelte figure goodbye. I\'ve accepted my fate. Tango\'s is going to make me curvy and I\'m not even mad about it. Life is short. \n\nIndigo & I give Tango\'s all the stars and extra points for noticing our matching leopard coats.', ""I have to admit that the only empanadas I've ever tasted are the ones that my Filipina aunt would share during family parties, and the ones that I made a few years back courtesy of Blue Apron. Both were delicious.\n\nBut let me tell you, the empanadas from Tango's Subs and Empanadas are at a different level. Located on Morris Hill in Boise, this gem serves some of the heartiest empanadas that you will ever get to taste. I ordered gaucho (the original empanada made of ground beef, onions, bell peppers, eggs, and green olives) and gardel (shredded chicken in a light marinara sauce), with fries and soda. Gaucho was surprisingly sweet but I loved it. Gardel was tasty too. And each was only $2.50!\n\nThe empanadas look big but they're airy. However, I think the meat-to-dough ratio is just perfect. Tango's Subs and Empanadas is a solid four stars. Nothing extraordinary with service on my first visit, so I'll keep it at four stars for now.\n\nWill I come back? Absolutely! Very curious about trying the other flavors!"", 'Tango\'s is a little hole in the wall on Orchard.  I wouldn\'t have looked twice if it wasn\'t for the yelp reviews (yay yelpers) and some word of mouth by friends.  And, thank God I did.  This place is not only so totally delicious that you\'ll find yourself gazing at your empanada whispering, where have you been all my life...but hands down the best service I\'ve received in all of Boise.  We were greeted upon entrance by one of the owners (Monica?  I think) and when we told her that our seven-year-old had never had an empanada--she immediately showed him what one looked like (she actually had a clay/plaster empanada for this very situation) and told him the most popular fillings for children.  This was awesome and completely demystified what had a moment before been ""weird food"" to my son.  I can\'t say enough about the service--she was so very sweet to us.  \n\nI ordered their Fugazza empanada, which was filled sautéed onions, mozzarella, and spices.  It was heady with herbs and flavor.  My dining companion ordered the Moleh, which was chicken in sweet sauce (chocolate, peanuts, and various chilies) and was pleased, though said the flavor was a bit unusual and wouldn\'t be for everyone (I didn\'t dig it).  My seven-year-old got the Hawaiian, which was the usual pineapple, ham, and mozzarella.  He was delighted.  The prices were incredible.  $2.25 per empanada.  We each had one, which was enough for me, but my dining companion could have eaten two plus dessert. \n\nWe didn\'t partake in the dessert empanadas as we had already promised the little guy fro-yo.

Applicants must, they said, be ""rock stars"" for customer service with at least a year in a high volume restaurant.  Must have been one of the ""rock star"" hires who served us during our first visit to Goodwood because she did a stellar job from the moment she introduced herself as trainee and the staff member who accompaned her for supervision.\n\nWhich is the long way of saying that among many good things at Goodwood we enjoyed on our first try here, at the top of the list was simply splendid service.  Along with the wood smoke aroma enticing us through the sparkling clean lobby to the friendly host to the seating in the ""all people are welcome here"" space to the good food at fair prices, our expectations were exceeded. \n\nBACKSTORY: Started as a single restaurant in about 1999 by a couple of friends, Goodwood now is small chain with Boise, Meridian and Utah locations. \n\nVIBE: Sparkling clean everywhere you look.  Even the barbecue sauce bottles on each table glisten.  \n\nYou will find a roll of paper towels on each table, just in case you need more than the hefty black cloth napkin at each place setting.  \n\nWalls are sort of cumin red on some walls and oregano green on others.  Booth seating was very comfy.  An inviting space with lots of windows and  high ceilings with open duct work that is painted black.\n\nWe saw people of all ages, from toddlers to octogenarians and all walks of life and physical abilities.  All people are welcome here.\n\nAs much as I am not a Country Western music fan, it fit in perfectly here and was at the just right level to support conversation and conviviality and not compete with it.\n\nMENU / FOOD : Starting with the important piece of information that this is an all scratch kitchen.  Everything is made here and made fresh, as our server told us.  Including the ranch dressing which I consider an abomination in commercial production.  Here, homemade as it should be, it was a delicious go with for our onion rings.\n\nBut I\'m getting ahead of myself.  Because the second most important thing is save room for a house made dessert or take one with you!  \n\nThe menu is broad from appetizers (if trying  onion rings but stick to a half order...trust me) to salads to non bbq options like salmon and steak to the expected bbq and sides.  Prices run from $2.19 (sides) to $17.99 (prime rib). They have a lengthy list of sides and entrees and we  noted options that would make a vegetarian happy as well as some for gluten free dining.\n\nWe shared a half order of onion rings that came with yummy (seriously) fresh ranch dressing ($6.49), pulled pork plate that came with two sides ($10.49) and ordered two more sides ($2.19 each) for a total of macaroni and cheese, coleslaw, baked beans and potato salad.  Here I admit that when I go to a BBQ place I am really there for the sides.  I would order the beans and coleslaw again.\n\nWe finished with Key Lime pie to go.\n\nLIBATIONS: When I go back I\'m going to try one of their specialty cocktails, like the spiked lemonade, from the full bar.\n\nVALUE: Total bill for all that food, no libations, for two with leftovers was only $26.35 before tax.  A great value.\n\nSERVICE: Stellar.  This is a team service approach with friendly, efficient server \'in the lead\' but teammates also run food, help clear table and so on.  We didn\'t feel hovered over but ""poof"" there was a server to do this or that, like remove used plates or fill water, before we needed them.  Hot food was served nice and hot, cold food was served perfectly cold reflecting great coordination between front of house and kitchen. \n\nTHIS N THAT:\n\n1) PARKING:  In large lot seems ample and for overflow there is an even larger lot just across the access road to the Homewood Suites.\n\n2) ACCESSIBILITY:  Accessible (aka ADA) parking right outside the front door (maybe 4 spaces).  Level in and throughout.  Several standard height tables and chairs.  Also booths.  Loo is accessible too.\n\n3) THE LOO:  Worth ""a word"".  It is as clean as all else.  And they have conveniently provided both wrapped mints and a pump bottle of mouthwash along with disposable cups at the sinks. I guess if you were on a hot date or going to an important business meeting, these could come in handy!\n\n4) ROOM SERVICE ANYONE?:  When we visit Boise we typically stay at Homewood Suites.  We just learned about two weeks ago that Goodwood provides room service for the Homewood.  Another reason to choose the hotel!', ""This will be a different review but I was extremely impress with the attention to detail.  \nFirst the food was so darn good.  I loved it way too much.\nSecondly, the staff was great and well trained.  The waitress we had was very friendly, helpful oh and super cute. haha.\n\nThe thing that impressed me the most was the attention to detail.  Our waitress was very mindful of the condition of our table.  3 males eating and making a big mess with napkins and bones etc.  She would come back periodically and remove our soiled napkins and say that we need to tidy it up so she doesn't get into trouble with her manager.  I also watched as another waitress clean and set up the table in front of us.  I have never seen anyone do this before, she used a flash light to clean above the table, under the table and the area around.  Really?  isn't the reason to keep a restaurant dark is so that the customers don't see the mess hidden on the carpets and under the tables.\n\nI was sure to seek out the manager and let him know how much I appreciated the tight ship they ran.  Wow.  I will be sure to pay this place a visit next time I am in Boise."", ""As soon as I walked towards this place from the parking lot, you are over taken by the wonderful smell of BBQ wafting out from thier kitchen. As you walk in the place it has a warm and inviting feel and we were greeted and seated right away. \n\nI had the St Louis style ribs and they did not disappoint\u200b, they were as good as the intoxicating smells we noticed in the parking lot. The baked patato was excellent, as good as any I've ever had. Additionally I sampled the beef brisket, it too was amazing. I would have been very satisfied had I picked that for my meal. \n\nOur server was great, I wish I remembered her name. We received our food reasonably quick for this type of restaurant, and she was there everytime we needed anything. \n\nThey also have a small bar in the corner, offering a nice selection of drinks.

Most important is the cheese. After doing some more research, I found out one of their signature things is using Grana Padano. This really adds an extra something that makes it stand out.\n\n-Wise Guy-\nAll the ingredients were solid and mixed well. Sausage and salami were tasty.

Bent Nails went all out to make sure the sellers weren't hiding anything that was wrong. The home was newer so there wasn't much wrong, made it easy to flip through the pages of the report. \n\nI was even more impressed when we had them once more inspect another house we bought in 2020. First off, the inspect report was fat! So much information. It was an older home, there was a lot to point out and our inspector made sure to notate every last detail. He went as far as to notate every single crack in the Sheetrock, even chips on the toilet! I say that is quality service worth your buck. I would definitely use their services again when I buy my third property, heehee! I wish you could find great house inspectors like this in every city!"", ""We have used Bent Nail for several inspections already.\nIf you want to be absolutely sure about your home purchase, Kevin Reynolds is your guy. I would not hesitate to use Kevin again if I was looking to purchase another property. He was so thorough that our Realtor actually became irritated at his attention to detail! (which isn't saying much for the Realtor) At the end of the day though, he is working for you, and not the Agent, and he knows that. The best money we spent was with Bent Nail and prevented us from having to spend thousands more. In fact, the picture of the drainpipe going through a cut floor joist on their site was a deal we walked away from thanks to Kevin. The whole experience from scheduling, to the inspection, to the report and the follow up was first class. Keep up the good work guys!"", ""This is our second inspection with Bent Nail.  They did a fantastic job and we loved the video which allowed us see the findings and still go to work during the day.    Bent Nail does a very close inspection and we trust their findings.   Don't buy a home either old or brand new construction without an inspection and use Bent Nail to get the job done.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,

Well, I have two reasons: 1 - Fried Mac and Cheese and 2 - Wilted Kale Salad.

Because they are not the standard salad, flavorless mac and cheese, or salty carb. These items are made with ingredients from scratch and recipes with care. The kale salad has complex flavors of mustard and balsamic vinegar, accented by mushrooms and parmesan. The generous servings of fries are thick cut and fried perfectly. And the mac and cheese, I will be honest, can be hit and miss, but never is it inedible. Where SLG really stands out is their sauces. The ketchup is not like any other ketchup, the dressing is not like something you can find in your standard restaurant, and this is why I am a SLG's most devout vegetarian customer. \n\nYour food might come out a little slow, and the big red headed guy might be kind of an asshole, but he's always willing to bullshit with the customers.

I ordered their Boulevardier, which is the fetching and always enticing cousin to the illustrious negroni. Substitute negroni's gin for bourbon and the jazz age darling of a cocktail is swirling in your glass.  A cocktail that if done well is divine, and if done poorly leaves a flavor too Campari precocious and bourbon deficient.  Fortunately, Saint Lawrence Gridiron does the Boulevardier and does it well. This spirit forward cocktail will leave your head humming and your toes tingling in the loveliest of ways.  \n\nNext, came appetizers. Our dining companions ordered the wings while my main dining companion and I opted for the poutine.  Poutine is Idaho meets Canada in one delicious dish.  I have had ho-hum poutine and I have had exemplary. Saint Lawrence Gridiron's interpretation of the dish is by far my favorite. Fries smothered in gravy with the sharp zing of bleu cheese (instead of the more traditional cheese curds), this is not a dish to be trifled with. It was gorgeous and beyond flavorful.  A word of warning, though--it is topped with beef--so not a vegetarians delight.\n\nFor my second cocktail, I had their traditional Old Fashioned. My dining companions found SL Gridiron's Old Fashioned a little too citrus forward. For my part, I found it to be spot on perfect.  But, then again, I like a little orange zestiness in my Old Fashioned.  It was rich, lovely, and smooth as Mulberry silk.\n\nFor my main dish, I ordered their macaroni and cheese. Delicious!  It's not the most creative interpretation, but it was exactly what mac and cheese should be.  It's pasta swimming in cheesy loveliness baked in its own cast iron casserole.  What's not to like?\n\nFor dessert, my dining companion and I shared their beignets and bread pudding and weren't wowed by either.  The beignets seemed to lack substance and the bread pudding wasn't terribly memorable.  Neither were bad, mind you, but they weren't fabulous either.\n\nThe service was friendly but often lagging a bit.  We sat on the patio, which may account for that.  The patio is protected by buildings on three sides, which is nice.  And, on occasion, they show movies out there.

I heard wonderful things and my fiancé and I were excited to taste their wedding cakes. I set up a cake tasting appointment mid-last week, indicating that my wedding was still a little over a year out. Since my fiancé and I are paying for the entire wedding entirely ourselves, we started planning early because we didn't want all the wedding costs to pile up all at once. \n\nThe morning of our appointment with Amaru, I received an email from the owner asking us to move our appointment to next year since cake prices will differ. Completely understandable, but my fiancé and I wanted to get a better understanding of the process, the (average) costs, and what we like/dislike. His email was friendly but it gave us the impression they were trying to dismiss us because of how far in advance we were trying to plan. I replied, indicating that we would still like to meet since we had plenty of questions.\n\nWhen we arrived, the owner sat us and left to go back to his office right around the corner. He wasn't rude but he made us feel our like our appointment was unappreciated and he made us feel unwelcome. During the actual cake tasting, the decorator left but never came back. We both felt like we were not taken seriously and we kept receiving odd looks and reactions from the cake decorator. My fiancé said (and I agree), that it was as if they were dismissing us because they knew they weren't going to make any money off us that day. I completely understand business needs but what ever happened to having the customer's satisfaction and happiness in mind? I would have been happy to pay for the tasting if they would have treated us more seriously. Had today gone well, I would have considered using them for my wedding cake. However, the service was definitely disappointing and the cakes we sampled were mediocre. I'll take my money to someone who doesn't mind working with early planners. It was a disappointing experience for something that should have been a happy and exciting event. The only reason I gave them two stars instead of one is because their signature buttercream frosting was delicious. \n\nWhen we went to talk to Sugar Rush the same day, they happily said they would do a tasting and book us for a year out.

Full stop.  Period.  If you search far and wide you may find pizza as good as Tony\'s.  Maybe.  But you won\'t find any better.  Ever.  I am a person not given to absolutes or hyperbole, so trust me when I tell you with certainty that Tony\'s pizza is penultimate!\n\nPizzeria Teatro was our destination dining stop as our first dinner meal on our first ""should we move to Boise"" tire kicking trip almost six years ago.  My husband, who is Sicilian heritage and grew up in an Italian neighborhood in Brooklyn in a household where his grandmother spoke only Italian, said ""I\'m home"" when we walked in the door then.  We feel the same way now.  (And this is a coincidence, my hubby and Tony went to competing high schools in Brooklyn.  Although decades apart for my old\'un hubby, he still considers both of them to be guys from the same neighborhood.  As New Yorkers are inclined to do, I guess.) \n\nNo matter what pizza you choose, it will be excellent.  The same can be said for the salads.  Not to mention a wine list that is \'perfetto\' for Italian fit.   And it is also the friendly service, lovely art on the walls, and great jazz classics music on the sound system that season the experience.\n\nSee my first review from 2013 if you find details helpful.  But I figured it was worth a review update as it surprises me to find how many people we talk with about superior places to eat in Boise have never heard of Tony\'s, including people who have lived here far longer than we (of our now five year residency.)  Tony\'s continues to be on our recommendation list for others for destination dining.  \n\nAlso as praise for Tony and his pizza, I share that a few weeks ago while dining at another eatery where pizza is on the menu, the owner sat down with us to ask what we thought of the pizza coming out of his kitchen.  This man, who also shares Italian heritage, said he too thought Tony\'s pizza was extraordinary and if Tony ever retired he was going to ask him for his pizza recipe.  ""Ah"", we said, ""But if Tony retires the pizza would never be the same, recipe or not, because there is the hand of the pizza artist in the making of Tony\'s pies that makes them so deliciously special.""\n\nThe only thing I would change here if I had a magic wand is the location.  Parking in this part of downtown is a bear  for anyone and in particular for me as I have MS and rely on accessible - aka complies with ADA - parking to be able to park and get out of my car and there isn\'t much of it in this part of downtown.  Plus, I live out in the west side wilds of Eagle.  So, if Tony ever wanted to move his pizzeria out to my side of town somewhere with a parking lot, I would be on auto-pilot for weekly dining.', 'Dinner at Tony\'s Pizzeria Teatro (theater in Italian) was a great choice on the night we arrived in Boise for a week\'s visit.  This meal was the best of the week for food excellence from start to finish. Add in vibe that made my Italian heritage, Brooklyn born and Italian neighborhood raised husband say right out loud ""I\'m home!"" the moment we walked in the door for the ambiance and aroma.  Fantastico!  \n\nMENU:  Includes about five salads (@ $7 - $10).  Also bout 16 Neapolitan styled pizzas (@ $13 - $15) in classic combinations as well as house specials and option to create your own from toppings listed.  Also five calzones. One dessert is offered, tiramisu ($5).\n\nFOOD:  We shared an Arristiti salad (@$10), generous enough to serve one as a meal or to be shared as a starter.   Fresh and delicious, it included fresh mozzarella, crispy romaine and oak leaf lettuce, tomatoes, roasted marinated bell peppers, capers and Gaeta olives.  Outstanding.  \n\nOur server brought chilled share plates to table knowing we planned to split the salad. Many restaurants miss the importance of this chilled detail for salad service. Just another element of attention to quality here.\n\nSalads come with a generous serving of flatbread, with a kiss of garlic, rosemary, salt.\n\nPizzas are one size, about 15"", and amply serve two. The crust is the thing in pizza and this crust is an excellent thing; thin, fired in pizza oven to brown on the bottom and chewy overall. Toppings were just right so as not to overwhelm the crust. Sauce is excellent.  Our choice of one of the house pizza specials of San Marzano tomatoes, housemade sausage, roasted garlic and spinach served piping hot from oven to table was delectable.\n\nThe tiramisu as made by Tony was just right for sweetness, using real mascarpone and easily fed two.  Save room!\n\nVINO:  Wine list leans to Italian (as it should) with a few domestic options and has maybe three whites by glass and half a dozen reds @$6 - $7. By bottle options, about $25 - $35, also tilted to reds but also a few whites including Prosecco. Our two glasses of good red wine clocked in at only $12.50 total.  A bargain.\n\nVIBE / SEATING:  Located downtown, right across from City Hall, yet the ambiance is neighborhood.  Brick and neutral colored walls were adorned with local art work.  Nice classic jazz and acoustic Italian music mix on the sound system set at a level to support and not compete with conversation. Narrow interior with tables, seating for maybe 15 total, positioned along the sides in a way that allowed passage through the restaurant. But it is a small space, so not a linger to chat place when other customers are waiting.  As tempting as that may be to do since Tony makes his guests feel so comfortably ""at home"" welcome.  Also outdoor seating for maybe 10 at tables on the sidewalk.   \n\nSERVICE:  Efficient and friendly server who knew both the menu and wine list well enough to make recommendations.   She made us feel most welcome.\n\nVALUE:  Salad, pizza, tiramisu, wine for two plus one espresso clocked in at only $43 before tax.\n\nBACKSTORY:  Originally from Naples, Tony grew up in Brooklyn.  Then back to Naples then to Florida and finally landed in Boise.  Lucky is Boise that Tony has put down roots there to make his pizza!  (FYI, Gino\'s Ristorante in Meridian is owned by Tony\'s brother.)\n\nTHIS N THAT:\n\n1) PARKING: Is a bear.  On street downtown but none in front.  Public garage next door.\n\n2) ACCESSIBILITY: Level in and throughout with path of travel to standard height seating and a couple of tables seem to have wheelchair clearance space. Getting a wheelchair into the narrow outdoor seating area may be impossible.  Accessible loo.', ""I had dinner at Tony's for a romantic date night with my true love. He knows I have a disgusting passion for pizza. Well, he sure does know the way to my heart. Tony's has perfect pizza. It tastes like it straight from a Napoli oven.

Only good at the State Street location.\n\n(Also, read the tips on Bowl of Heaven Cafe\'s Yelp business page, and learn how to get your loyalty card double-stamped.)\n\nAfter all, chances are that once you try a Bowl of Heaven, you\'ll be loyally back for more.\n\nI know that I will.\n\nP.S. Yes, the location (while economically sound from a business owner\'s point-of-view) on State Street is a little out of place.

Growler\'s is next to a dance studio and Chiropractors office. There is ample parking. \n\nOnce you walk into the restaurant you see how spacious it is; however, you quickly learn that the set up of the counter, as seen in other reviews, is confusing and cramped.  You have to pull a menu off the wall and look at it. Meanwhile, people are coming in behind you and you\'re holding up the line. If you go to the left, people can\'t get to the trash can and you have to move away. If I were the owner, I would think about moving the salad bar and the register.\n\nThe menu is full of pizza, burgers, and fries. They have a salad bar, which is hard to find on a weekend or non lunch hours. As you approach the register you see that the counter is full of wood-- which goes to the bear in the woods theme. The wall behind the counter is a chalk board with the drink menu. They have all sorts of beer, wine and non alcoholic beverages to chose from. Near the counter is the entrance to the kitchen and on both sides of the door is chalk boards that tell about happy hour and the Growler merchandise that you can buy (t-shirts and hats). While placing the order you\'re given a number which is two pieces of wood with a number on it, keeping up with the wood them, and very unique, I liked it. \n\nWalking away from the counter you are given the selection of many different sitting areas. There is a very large, beautiful, table (see photos), a bar in the back with a television (sport on), a back patio with ample seating, normal tables, and lifted tables with stools. \n\nThe salad bar-- I, personally, found it to be very good. The plate they give you is super small, but it worked for me, but I don\'t each much. It was smaller than a normal saucer plate. The salad bar had lettuce, spinach, carrots, beans, sliced tomatoes, bell pepper, pineapple, onion, olives, beets, Pepperoncini, pepperoni, ham, pasta, garbanzo beans, egg, cottage cheese, and a few other items I forgot. There are many dressings, which are in large pour-able containers, which makes it much easier and cleaner than ladling. There are nuts, croutons, bacon bits  and more to top your salad off with. The salad bar, as of this writing, is AYCE $9.99, one time $6.99, and add to any pizza or burger for $3.99.\n\nNext is the soda counter. Here you can find your silverware, napkins (good quality), straws, toothpicks, ketchup, mustard, peppers, Parmesan cheese, and hot sauce. The serve Coke products and iced tea. \n\nOn each table is a wood lazy susan with pepper and salt on them. The seats are comfortable. The food is brought to you and they have excellent customer service. \n\nThe food-- the salad I felt was delicious. It\'s just the normal items and dressings, nothing that they ""made"" per se, but the quality and freshness of the items made it a good salad, plus they have good ranch, which to me, is a make it or break it. My dining companion got the Philly cheese-steak sandwich. He kept moaning MMM while he ate-- which is surly a sign that he enjoyed it. He enjoyed his fries, too, although they didn\'t look appetizing to me as they were dark and looked overcooked, but he thought that wasn\'t the case at all. The steak wasn\'t the usually thing sliced steak, it was more hamburger than steak. It came with a side of mustard-fry sauce mixture (could be off on that, but its what it looked and tasted like). \n\nWelcome to the neighborhood Growlers! I hope you have a long and successful relationship with the community! Best of luck! You\'re off to a great start!!!', ""Discovered this place from a friend's referral. We attended on their 1year anniversary. The place was busy, but the service was still great. They have indoor and outdoor seating. Outdoor seating is perfect this time of year. \n\nWe have been back twice since (literally the following day after our first time). My husband fell in love with their calzones. They are custom built is one of the best calzones I've had in a very long while. \n\nThey have a great beer selection as well as some wine. Their salad bar is also something to not pass up. One of these days we will venture off and try some of their other menu items.. but for now, it's an amazing calzone and salad bar fix for sure."", ""When there's brand new zaza on Overland, you know your boys PizzaKen and PizzaTom will have it covered. This is the second Growler's to open. First is up in McCall. I guess they must be doing pretty well if they're able to open another place here in Boise. What's with bears and pizza? I feel like a lot of pizza places have a bear or wood cabin theme? How many pizzas do you think a mama bear could eat before going into hibernation?\n\nThe interior looks a lot like one of those edgy breweries, or an incubator for startups. It's clean but welcoming. We were surprised at how many families were dining on a weeknight. We got two 12-inchers: a pepperoni and a Big Growler. The pepperoni was $13 but the Growler was $20 (pricey for a 12″). Took 15-20 mins to arrive.\n\n-Pepperoni-\nA very traditional american-styled pie. Think Flying Pie or Red Baron's. There wasn't anything super exciting about it but it was good. The ingredients were pretty fresh but no x factor.\n\n-The Growler-\nIt's a meat lovers with sausage, salami, pepperoni, and jalapeno bacon. Very good. Again, not super compelling. The jalapeno bacon just tasted like bacon.\n\n-Verdict-\nThis place is good but nothing really stood out about it. We had a pleasant experience and it's nice to see more pizza places open up. You can never have too much pizza in this beautiful city. We recommend this place if you like bear mascots.\n\n3 slices out of 5""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

Shanna and Stan have both been reachable and replied promptly and thoroughly to my queries.\n\nI am thankful to have met such experienced, helpful, and professional people and highly recommend AAD Inspection Corp for your inspection needs.', ""3.5 Stars.  Very thorough for the most part.  I found several boilerplate items left in their report that make it clear they did not look at the item on site and did sporadic inspection on certain items such as the foundation/stem walls.  One simple item: the dryer vent was noted in the report that it terminates above the roof, when in actuality it terminates just above grade through the foundation wall.  This makes me wary of whether they inspected the entire foundation or not because they would have clearly seen the ONLY vent penetration in the foundation (our crawlspace is ventilated and therefore has no other vents through the foundation wall).  Some small items like this worry me that they didn't do a thorough inspection on some aspects of the house, but they did catch some items that i would not have thought to look for on new construction such as missing vapor barrier in the crawl space.  I would have assumed since it was new construction that all vapor barriers would have been installed, but alas they were not.  Overall: good experience.

They had a booth and let us sample a couple of their kinds of pasta. I really enjoyed it and wanted more, yet never made it that way. After well over a year of ""meaning"" to try it, I did it! I met two people for lunch and we chose to sit outside on their patio facing Milwaukee St. \n\nI was craving pasta, yet trying to avoid carbs and I was pleasantly surprised to see that they now make their pasts with veggies, too. You can get zucchini noodles in place of the noodle! Yes!! We got the chicken curry, mac n cheese, pot stickers (6 for $5), Asian meatballs (10 for $5), and steak stroganoff. All very good. I. Want. More!\n\nAfter we ordered, we were given a number and to select a seat. We chose the patio. My friend, who ordered her food before me, waited 5 additional minutes for her food to arrive. Now its counter service so the people making the food wouldn\'t have known we were at the same table, but it still sucked. So not docking them for this. \n\nWhat I am docking them was the cleanliness of the soda/silverware station-- kinda gross. Generally, if  the mess looked fresh or is customer caused and they\'re slammed kind of a way I get that, but this looked simply unclean... standing water next to the lids and behind the to-go boxes, water stains, and some dried on food. Other than this area, it would have been a 5 star great experience for me. \n\nI plan to eat here again soon!', ""This was my first visit to Noodles & Company. We got our order to go. It was fairly busy but they did a good job of social distancing and all staff were wearing masks.\nI got the Penne Rosa but substituted the any noodle cauliflower rigatoni.

Next time we'll call ahead for our order to go. \nNote:  you have to ask for napkins and forks."", ""How is it that a chain can be relatively good at one location and totally suck at their other locations?

Nothing to brag about. Will not go back. And just had lunch at the new location on Broadway. I'm sick. It was disgusting. The best part of the meal: the soda machine. The worst? Pasty parmesan crusted chicken. Dirty knives wrapped in napkins. Dirty tables waiting to be bussed. Pasty and icky noodles. Garbage tastes better. For 9 bucks, I deserved a far better lunch.

The lighting is excruciatingly frustrating if you want to take decent pictures but really excellent for looking sultry without trying. #Effortless \n\nI sat at the bar where there were two dapper bartenders wearing mustaches, suspenders, and overall looking very 1920s. This matched the music which I recognized as Parov Stelar (remixed swing music from  the 20's) that was being played at a reasonable volume. \n\nService was fabulous and I was never forgotten about. I had a ginger beer which was great, not sweet enough to kill a unicorn, but just right.

How is that connected?  Because I learned the BFC owner is the financial investor for  Press & Pony.  Good on him for that.\n\nWe likely will be one and done as Press & Pony customers but it was a fun visit, great service from the bar tender, top notch preparation of Pisco Sour (for me) and a Bloody Mary (for my hubby) that included a molasses and chili salt crusted rim, all enjoyed in a well designed nod to the past space.  A hour well spent even if I did have to hoist myself up on to high seating to do it.  (And there\'s the rub for less than 5 stars.)\n\nSERVICE & VIBE:  The drinks were not only delicious to taste but also beautiful to see.  Sipping them in the romantically dimly lit 1920\'s interior designed space while enjoying the classic music tunes of years past (think Louis Armstrong\'s rendition of ""You can\'t take that away from me"" or a chanteuse singing ""Someone to watch over me"") made me need to bite my tongue not to sing along as I sipped.  And given we were older by at least double the average age of the people who filtered in while we were there (only about seven folks at 4:30 but by our 5:30 departure on a weeknight, the place was over half full and counting) I\'ll betcha I\'m the only person in there who would know the lyrics.  Applause to the bar tender because as much as we may have seemed to him ""escapees from the home"" given how much senior we were to any other of his guests, he treated us with the same good welcome and care.\n\nHAPPY HOUR:  Specials (4p - 6p on some nights) are in the Boise mode I do not like of buy-one-get-one but that means the same person needs to order two cocktails.  My ability to drink two cocktails without it \'hurting\' the next day is in my rear view mirror and my husband never does as he\'s the designated driver.  So for people like us a discount on a single drink would make us much more happy.  Regardless, the space was so pleasant and we had come from a real estate and building developer meeting that had left me feeling the worse about things and that pretty first Pisco sour tasted so good going I did have another.  (The coupe glass in which it was served is small after all.)  Two expertly prepared cocktails for me for only $10 was a true bargain. \n\nPARKING:  On street.  A lot adjacent was largely empty but couldn\'t tell if it was open to public or reserved by monthly pay.\n\nACCESSIBILITY:   Wheelchair access symbol in the window and it is level in and throughout the small space.  So it was surprising to find only high seating available at bar and banguette as that is not wheelchair accessible.  I have had MS for 4 decades, am ambulatory with great difficulty and hoisting myself up into high seating - as I did this visit - is nearly impossible so I asked about standard height seating one might assume available (and required by Civil Rights law ADA so that people of my minority might be able to equally participate with all others) given the logo and given on my next visit a ""hoist"" might not be at all doable.  The nice bartender told us he had a \'flip down\' top at the bar that he could flip down to seat two people if standard seating was needed.\n\nBE NOT AFRAID BEER DRINKERS!:  They had about five on tap including Crux Pilsner and Anderson Valley Bourbon Barrel Stout.\n\nWINE DRINKERS:  I am.  But here I wouldn\'t.  The list is not much.  But with such great cocktails, no worries!', 'Press & Pony is the tavern equivalent to that British synth pop sensation ""Just Can\'t Get Enough"" by 80\'s alt-band extraordinaire Depeche Mode.\n\nWhich, is to say--they\'re my jam.\n\nNot that the atmosphere is remotely 80\'s vintage. No...it\'s far more vintage than that. In fact, it borders on the antique--with its low lit copper topped bar haloed by old fashioned lanterns. Even the bartenders with their suspendered, mustachioed charm harken to a simpler time.\n\nWhich, let\'s face it, is just plain cool.\n\nBut, hey--atmosphere and bartender style aside--how are the drinks?\n\nMy people.  \n\nMasterfully crafted--inventive with classic underpinning--tongue tingling ambrosia\n\nWhich, is to say--exceptional.\n\nI have had occasion to try a few of their cocktails.  Their Old Fashioned is an ample, distinctive, luxurious delight. The Denim Blazer is the pumpkin twist to that audacious flaming phantasmagorical wonder--the Blue Blazer. Their classic Manhattan is spot on perfect.\n\nBut, where they really rocked my liquid loving socks--was with their La Manzana.  Here\'s the thing--I dig tequila.  But, what I\'ve found, is that many of the upscale lounges that specialize in inventive mixology--do very little with the spirit. Vodka? Check. Gin? Check. Whiskey, Bourbon, Scotch, Rye? Check, check, check, CHECK!  The best you can hope for with tequila is some obligatory, salt-rimmed, variation of a margarita. Hey...I\'m not knockin\' it.  Who doesn\'t love a good margarita?\n\nBut, I\'m always left longing for a bit more.  A cocktail that will take tequila\'s pithy, pronounced pungency and weave it into an alchemists dream.\n\nLa Manzana does just that. Light, lovely, and lemony, with the lush elegance of elderflowers and autumnal apples--La Manzana is silky sublime indulgence\n\nIt\'s just. that. good.\n\nBeyond the atmosphere and drinks--their bartenders are incredibly knowledgable about the spirits they mix, certainly, but also about the history and evolution of alcohol.

Prices are low.  So is the quality of the food.  But you get a lot of it.  So if low price and high volume for awful eats is your litmus, this will pass the test.  Otherwise, you can pass it by.\n\nIt is not often I feel 'had' by Yelp, but this time I did.  I actually made this \nstrip-mall-across-the-street-from-Edwards-Theater located eatery a destination given a few glowing reviews. Don't make that mistake.  My friend Carl Y tells me the word I was looking for when I shared with him my experience here might best be captured in a phrase people of Cantonese heritage like to use: \xa0哎呀.  Sounds like Āiyā.  Expressing shock or surprise.  I could open and close with only that and this review would be shorter yet on point.\n\nTHE DRILL & THE VIBE:  Order at the counter from a menu board overhead or use a  paper menu for reference.  The nice girls at the counter will try to answer questions but don't seem to know much about Chinese food.  If you plan to eat in, take seat at formica-esque tables and chairs in front, or walk to the back for a booth.  They'll deliver food to you on real plates with forks.  Chopsticks on request.  They bus for you.  You'll enjoy (yes, I'm being facetious in choosing that verb) a Justin Bieber-ish play mix at too high volume while you eat.\n\nTHE FOOD:  Lousy, in my non-expert opinion although I did eat a lot of great Chinese food in years of working near Chinatowns in SF and NYC.  That said, all was not lost here.  The pork mu shu had lots of good, crunchy cabbage in it.  And, thank goodness, although the menu said it was served with duck sauce...really...it came with hoisin as it should...although the pancakes were more like flour tortillas than Chinese pancakes.\n\nOur choices also included what should have been spicy dry wok green beans that were not spicy and served with way too much sweet brown sauce.  And they served perhaps the very worst tofu dish we have had anywhere.  Mapo Tofu is a Chinese classic, spicy, and when served from a skilled kitchen it is a delightful dish.  We thought it a good omen to see on the menu here.  But this was bland on every level with the cubes of tofu seemingly just tossed onto the terrible sauce and all served barely lukewarm.  Add a pile of room temperature and gloppy veggie chowmein, steamed rice shaped like a block and, well, there was a lot of food to leave behind.\n\nFood PS: egg rolls are described on menu as filled with ground beef. If hamburger filled egg rolls aren't a clue for American-esque focused kitchen, I don't know what is.\n\nTHE LOO:  They have no bathroom.  Not only in the restaurant, but in the building in which the restaurant sits.  So to use the loo you have to walk across the plaza, into a separate building and down a long hallway to find a bathroom across from the Boise Barber College.  It is my understanding that Idaho code requires a restaurant serving food with eat-in tables to have a bathroom in the building in which it sits while take-out only places (think Papa Johns) do not.  IF this code is violated here, it is failure shared by the strip mall developer and the restaurant owner.  Regardless, it is a know before you go issue that if you need to go you have to hike to a different building. \n\nACCESSIBILITY:  Once in the door, all is on one floor.  Booths are not accessible.  Tables at front are.  The parking in this newish strip mall is not compliant for ADA minimums that have been Federal Civil Rights law and State Code for 27 years.  A person using a wheelchair find it impossible to find parking that didn't require them to travel against traffic in the car lane to get from the parking spot to the door.  That is both dangerous and illegal.  That is the developer's failure, not the restaurant owners.  \n\nOPTIONS:  You can do better than this at Yen Ching in Boise or Wok Fusion or Red Pavilion, both in Meridian."", ""This place has one of the best hot and sour soup in Boise and so in spite of the sometimes hour to hour and a half delivery time, I will wait every time. Even though there is a wait, food is always hot when delivered... and we're in the north end. They are over by Edwards on Overland. It's a drive, but they have always got our order right and deliver when they say they will. \n\nWe have ordered here a number of times, and each time we have been happy. That being said, some food is better than others. Quality food, fresh and tasty. I think that I would have given 3.5 stars if possible... but the soup is so good that it bumped it up a notch."", 'My husband and I were in the mood for Chinese food after a week of camping in the backcountry so we turned to Yelp to help us find a good restaurant. Boasting a 4-star rating, we decided to try Guang Zhou which is located near the Edwards cinema. \n\nWe had an address and a sign was located on Overland directing us into the parking lot. We drove the whole lot with no luck and ended up having to call to get directions. We  finally arrived and saw the place was nearly empty (clue #1).    At Guang Zhou, you order and pay at the counter then sit for service (clue #2).  The  only encouragement we had was a small sign saying, ""This is not fast food. We make everything fresh.""  We ordered our food and found a table. \n\nMy husband\'s won ton soup came out first. The broth was quite tasty but the won ton itself was a little underwhelming. Next came the entrees. The pecan chicken was decent at first but I just couldn\'t finish it as each bite I took, the taste worsened.  My husband\'s egg foo young failed the test too. The star of the show, the egg, took a backseat to the vegetables. The pork fried rice and the steamed rices were dry and lacking flavor. We were about to leave when out came our potsticker appetizers. Seriously, I had forgotten we had ordered them. Again, I was disappointed. The potsticker meat was bland. Even pouring extra sauce on them didn\'t help. \n\nThe dinner wasn\'t a comeplete disaster though. The iced tea and Pepsi were very refreshing and the refills were timely. We also did not over eat--which is better for our waistlines. \n\nAll in all, it was a wasted $30 and without a doubt, the worst Chinese food we\'ve ever eaten in our lives. Panda Express and mall food court Chinese is better than Guang Zhou.\n\nSo, if you think Panda Express is stellar, you\'ll like Quang Zhou. For the  rest of you who know what good Chinese food is supposed to taste like,  don\'t waste your time or money.  \n\nSorry Quang Zhou. I don\'t like writing bad reviews but your food just did not do it for us.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0

I was pleasantly surprised by this Whole Foods and its offerings.', 'We had no idea Boise had a Whole Foods until we drove by this big one, nearly a city block square in size it seemed to us and just on the cusp of downtown.  Of course we had to go in and explore.  Our first impression was that this newly opened (November 2012) Whole Foods was a good one.  The store is well stocked, well laid out and stafed by friendly people.  In particular we were taken with the artisan bread and wine selections and the multitude of choices in the oive bar.  (Some bread, olives and wine and we are good to go for a meal on some nights.)\n\nThe Whole Foods in our town, which we like a lot and shop at regularly, is a ""mini me"" version of most Whole Foods stores.  But it is also staffed with super friendly people and we weren\'t surprised to learn, after the fact of our Boise visit, that a couple of the Team Leaders at this Boise store once worked at the store in our home town. \n\nNew discoveries for us in  Boise to take away were Noosa (a Colorado company) strawberry rhubarb yogurt and fresh Nampa ID raspberries. Our regret after getting home is we didn\'t have more room in our cooler for more of that yummy yogurt since our store doesn\'t carry it. \n\nIf we lived in Boise we\'d shop here.  Next time we visit Boise we\'ll be back here.\n\nTHIS N THAT:\n\n1) PARKING:  Ample amount in private lot.  Note on your first trip in you may find the parking lot confusing as the main entry and bulk of parking is around the side from where you intuitively think it would be.\n\n2) ACCESSIBILITY:  Great as in most Whole Food stores from parking lot through the door and throughout.  Elevator to second floor where River Room is located.', 'Nicest Whole Foods on earth. And I live by many nice locations. But this one is superb. \nGreat, clean design.\n\nMost importantly, the customers are atypical Whole Foods shoppers.

New Jersey and the New York City area of New York (there\'s a huge difference between the New York City area and the rest of New York) has some of the best bagels (not to mention pizza, delis, hot dogs and Italian food) so my standards are kind of high. So with my review of Blue Sky Bagels, I will try to take into account that to paraphrase Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" we aren\'t in New Jersey (as opposed to Dorothy not being in Kansas).\n\nI will say that the exterior is attractive and inviting. Walking in, I found it similarly inviting and a pleasant place to grab a bagel and cream cheese. Service was relatively friendly and the pricing was fair.\n\nI opted for the everything bagel with the jalapeno cream cheese. I found the bagel to be ok, nothing spectacular, but nothing despicable and terrible. Again, I understand it is not New York and/or New Jersey, but I was hoping for more. Also, they were rather light on the cream cheese. In New Jersey and New York, a bagel with a schmear of cream cheese usually equals the bagel with an inch or more of the cream cheese, here they put way too little on.\n\nAgain, I understand I am not in New Jersey or New York, but I just expected a bit more. Food has crossed state lines and you should get at least a decent version if what was once a regional thing. I have found great sushi in Vegas, great Italian in Florida. I was even shocked finding good barbecue up in Jersey. I remember twenty years ago when I lived up there, we had a place that we thought was good, then I moved to the south and found out it was terrible. On my last trip home to Jersey, I found some wonderful places. Sadly, this place just did not rise above mediocrity. It wasn\'t bad, it just wasn\'t anything special.\n\nI give it three stars (), not terrible, just not exceptionally good. If you are dying for a bagel and are by here, well, it will probably satiate that craving, but will leave you feeling a bit sad afterwards, missing the greatness that a bagel and cream cheese can be.', ""I have had a few bagels in my day but these are the best! I remember many people around Boise telling me that Blue Sky had the best bagels and I would roll my eyes into my head. I thought, they are just bagels how good can they be? Well, well, well, let me tell you I am now addicted to the asiago bagel. No really, I am!\n\nWhen I order a bagel to go, I dig through the day old bagels in hopes of finding a bag of asiagos to take home ($2.00). When I don't, my day feels sad. I did go out on a limb and bought parmesan day old and yup, they are good too! Someday I will try a sandwich but for now, asiago, toasted with a smear of cream cheese please!"", 'Overall, this place offers mediocre food and coffee for the price they charge. My husband went to pick up breakfast for the two of us, he asked for bacon on both bagel sandwiches, and the server not only did not put bacon on either one of them, but also messed up the cream cheese flavors. Now my husband is getting heartburn from the spicy chipotle cream cheese. I called them to for speak to a manager about this and was told ""one moment"". They put me on hold for 3 minutes then hung up on me.  I don\'t think this place is ever gonna get our business back.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0

My fascination with King Tutankhamun (or King Tut as he is more commonly known today) started in high school when I wrote a paper about Ancient Egypt. Learning about the discovery of his tomb and gaining insights into life in Ancient Egypt and the governance of the ""boy king"" were all very fascinating to me. How lucky are we that we get to experience the King Tut Exhibition here in the Treasure Valley?!\n\nKing Tut was just nine years old when he became King, hence he is often referred to as a ""boy king."" He ruled for less than a decade; he died at age nineteen. His final resting place is small and unassuming, compared to many other burial tombs. However, it remained untouched for more than 3,000 years. In 1922, his tomb was discovered by Howard Carter and fellow archaeologist Lord Carnarvon (yes, the 5th Earl of Carnarvon who was Lord of Highclere Castle, the Castle in which the hit British period drama Downton Abbey was filmed!!!).\n\nA critical information that needs to be pointed out is that *not* all of the objects from the exhibition are actually from King Tut\'s tomb. The exhibition is full of both reproductions and real Ancient Egyptian artifacts. It took ten years to develop with the help of artisans from the Pharaonic Village in Egypt and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Is there value to seeing reproductions of real artifacts? I think so. The real thing would provide a whole new experience, but reproductions of real artifacts are perhaps the next best thing especially during COVID-19.\n\nTraveling exhibitions such as King Tut cost more to bring to the Discovery Center of Idaho (DCI), and so DCI had to raise admission prices accordingly (see their website for updated prices). Because of COVID-19, DCI implemented a couple of changes to make the experience safer for everyone, such as limiting the number of people that can get in, requiring masks for the entire visit, not accepting cash. These all made for a comfortable, enjoyable visit, though. It was not crowded, so social distancing was fairly easy to observe. Also, all of the hands-on exhibits were closed. Aside from the King Tut Exhibition, they still have the Tinker the T-Rex skeleton and genuine fossils on display as well. \n\nI feel like anyone could have easily breezed through the King Tut Exhibition in 15 minutes, but not me. I\'m the person that reads every single word on a museum label/caption. Yep, I\'m THAT friend. Haha.\xa0\n\nOverall thoughts? If Ancient Egypt is not your thing, then visiting the Discovery Center of Idaho is probably not a good idea right now. But if you\'re an Ancient Egypt geek like myself, then you would enjoy the exhibit\xa0so please go and support DCI! And please wear a mask. :-)', ""If you want to broaden your places to go with kids at, definitely have this as #1 on your list. Science & Engineering, this is what this place is all about & they're hands on! They change exhibits twice a year I think which is good but i would love for them to do it quarterly. My daughter started coming here when she was less than 2 & loved it! They used to have a play grocery store which was one of her fav & actually my sons too but they're gone for good which was sad!

Eat dessert first."" -Ernestine Ulmer\n\n80th person to review The Shed, downtown Boise, near Ann Morrison Park and Boise State Dorms. This is my 428th review on Yelp. \n\nAs Ulmer suggests above-- eat dessert first and here is a must! My friend and fellow Yelper, Dani S, treated us to deep-fried Oreo\'s at the end of our meal, which is amazingly delicious! The cookie becomes soft and the cream filling explodes with flavor as opposed to just eating, or dunking, and oreo-- interesting concept. They have only two desserts, Crème Brulee, and deep-fried Oreos. On our visit, the Crème Brulee was not set yet, which worked well for us! \n\nThis establishment is popular, especially the nightlife. Inside has multiple sports flags such as the Oakland A\'s, and the now Las Vegas Raiders. There are two outdoor areas-- both front and back porch, which accommodates about 7-8 tables. \n\nA full bar and an averagely sized menu. The food was very good! \n\nI ordered the shrimp avocado cocktail-- $9.50 \nThe shrimp was ample, juicy, and served with a bed of lettuce with perfectly flavored cocktail sauce. The avocado was sparing. \n\nNachos- $11.50 + $2.00 to add chicken-- a super large portion size meant to be shared by many. The flavors were spectacular and blended well together. The jalapenos were fresh and large in size. Onion, tomato, refried beans, guacamole, sour cream and a blend of ranch dressings. \n\nI tried one of my dining companions fries and they were super tasty-- she ordered a side of blueberry ketchup, which was extremely tasteful. \n\nThe drinks-- to me, they were a little pricey at $10 a drink, and nothing too special. They do have a menu with lots of good sounding drinks, but just meh for me. My dining companion Chanda ordered a drink with fresh mint which looked beautiful. I recommend the Shed Painkiller, especially if you like Pineapple, which I do! I also ordered the spiced Paloma, which I wasn\'t a fan of. \n\nMy recommendation-- GO TO THE SHED! Order dessert first, consume some drinks and enjoy your life, your friends, and yourself! Happy dining, friends.', ""Some yelp turned real life friends (Greg, Chanda, George) wanted to go to The Shed for lunch. I was curious about it. Especially after my Spirit Animal Miki wrote a hilariously entertaining review about her take on the place. I had to check it out for myself. \n\nI ordered the cucumber salad because I planned on getting the dessert and didn't want to spoil my appetite. The cucumbers were... lets face it, I didn't actually care about the salad. \n\nI was only interested in conversing with my new friends and dessert. Because life's too short. The dessert I selected was by default, because the creme brûlée hadn't set yet.The only available option was the Deep Fried Oreo Cookies. \n\nI'm not an Oreo cookie fan. I wouldn't turn one down, I wouldn't cross the street for one, and I don't recall ever buying them on purpose. Until Sunday. Sunday I found myself left with no choice but to order them, deep fried no less.\n\nIt was the best deep fried anything I've ever had, my friends enjoyed them as well. They're pure unfiltered deep fried magic. I dream about them, I see them when I close my eyes, I can smell them if I concentrate, and my friend Greg mentioned that he can still taste them... \nThey weren't crunchy, they were pillow soft and melty in the middle and the dunking sauce was a nice, although not necessary, option.\n\nI can confidently recommend the Deep Fried Oreos! I don't believe any other Boise area restaurants have them. Get 2 baskets because 5 cookies just isn't enough! Parking is a beach and if you don't want to risk getting towed, park at Ann Morrison Park and walk over.\n\nThis is guiltless consumption of calories at its finest because there's exercise involved. You're welcome. Enjoy!"", 'You know when you see a smart kid who could really go on to do extraordinary things, like identify the cure for cancer or successfully implement commercial space flight, but instead they become a meth dealer and end up in prison? That\'s what this place is. \n\nLet me explain.\n\nThe location is awesome, located in a quaint BSU neighborhood. The parking is nonexistent (what architect or counselor needs 24/7 parking AND permits? Do small businesses support each other anymore?), but we found something on the street soon enough (luckily it was after 6 so we didn\'t risk getting towed, especially since it the entire ordeal lasted three hours). The place itself has a really cool atmosphere, and displayed the greatest thing I\'ve ever seen - two taxidermy ducks doing the nasty. I hope I can find that on eBay because I really need it in my bathroom (which won\'t wreak of urine like The Shed\'s did). Maybe I\'ll buy it at auction when this place goes out of business for treating their customers like garbage. \n\nSo, we get there. There\'s maybe 10 people in the dining area. I have 8 people with me. We sit down. We order drinks. We order food. Of the 8 dishes we ordered, 5 people received them. After two hours. No, I\'m not exaggerating. Of the 15 drinks we ordered, 11 were received. Of the 6 checks we requested, 4 of them were delivered and 2 of them were ""comped"" (that\'s after the waitress took my boyfriend\'s credit card to pay a bill and returned an empty checkbook. No receipt. No credit card. No kidding.) Well, we *were* told items were comped, until everyone left except our two friends who were finally eating the meal they ordered three hours prior. To further test their patience, they were eventually slapped a check with the formerly-declared ""comped"" items. Seriously?\n\nTo recap: It took 3 hours to get a portion of the food and drinks we ordered. We were told items would be comped for the terrible service. The comped items suddenly reappeared after all but two of our party left. Those two paid it because they have decency, unlike The Shed.\n\nMost people would blame the waitress, but that\'s not the case here. She was brand new, didn\'t even know the menu, and it was the NCAA championship game (tonight). Who schedules a new waitress on what ended up being an 60+ person dining room on a huge game night where the closest divisional team to Boise was playing in a championship for the FIRST TIME EVER? \n\nI\'m guessing it was the blonde woman with the green cardigan and sideways pony tell sitting in the corner, being completely unhelpful and drinking while she watched this one new waitress struggling to do her job. I hope she was the manager and not the owner, because her behavior towards her employees and her customers was disgusting and, at least as a manager, she can get fired. \n\nGood luck to this place, and to the brunette waitress tonight in the trucker hat - good on you. I\'m sorry you\'ve been cursed with such inconsiderate employers and I hope you can find a quality establishment to work at in the future that actually values you as an employee and human being.']",0.4,0.0,0.0,0.6,0.0,1.0,30.0

The food came out super quick - not that B&G ever takes long. The smell of bacon and hot gravy had my mouth watering the second it was placed in front of me. There was so much gravy. Personally, I think B&G should be more G&B. There was a generous amount of chopped bacon, which made up for the insane lack of sausage in the gravy. I wish there was a little more cheese, with how much was on my plate I wouldn\'t have noticed if it was there or not. The green onions were a delicious addition, albeit a bit strong, so be prepared and okay for onion breath the rest of the day. Generous portion sizes, too.

It is also nice that there is free WiFi and parking. Please note that this location has plenty of Tesla charging stations in the parking lot for those that may find this feature beneficial.\n\nBeing that I have had a great experience at previous locations, I knew I had wanted to stay at this location when visiting Boise. I made a reservation on hotels.com because they were able to offer a cheaper price per night than Oxford Suites' website. I stayed here a few nights with my husband and our little girl dog last month. Unfortunately, the evening reception still was not offered because of the pandemic so we only were able to enjoy the complementary breakfast each morning.\n\nOur room had a microwave and small mini fridge. The bathroom was very spacious and also had both a shower and separate bath tub. This is the only hotel where I really love their body wash, shampoo and conditioner. Typically other places give you the bar soap that dries out your skin and the shampoo and conditioner also ruin your hair, which is why I always bring my own. But their products are much better quality and smell fantastic. I also like that the bathroom has liquid hand soap instead of the bar soap, which does not dry out my hands.\n\nWhile staying here, we ended up using the coin operated washer and dryer, which cost $1 each. The washer and dryer can be found in the basement. There is also a little business conference room with computers available if you need to use it. If you need to print something, each guest gets the first 10 black and white prints out for free, in which you can pick up at the front desk (which was nice since I had to print out a page). With the pool and sauna, it is indoors. You can request towels at the front desk. There is also a fitness center but unfortunately was closed during this visit, because of the pandemic (as one employee had informed me when I was down in the basement looking for it).\n\nFor breakfast, at the other Oxford Suites, you are able to get an omelet made to order, in addition to getting other hot food items like sausage/ bacon, potatoes, etc (whatever is available for that day) and then other food items on your own (beverages, cereals, fruit, pastries eat). But because of the pandemic, at this location, I lined up and had to wait for an employee to ask me what items I wanted and place them on a tray going down the line.\n \nDuring my visit, I had breakfast items that included breakfast burrito, breakfast sandwich (on a croissant), scrambled eggs, potato, bacon. The breakfast was filling and I enjoyed it (even ended up saving the breakfast burritos to consume later too since it was individually wrapped). Pancakes and waffles were also offered but I didn't choose to get any but figured I would mention these offerings for those that do like having them.

A nice bathroom with separate tub, shower and toilet area. A small sink area with fridge, microwave and coffee maker. Two queen beds, couch, desk and TV.

Newly built or remolded (not sue which) with fairly comfortable furniture and beds. The bathroom in the queen room side was really nice. Large counter, walk-in shower, separate toilet.

Both of the mountains are very different but my favorite out of both was Targhee. The feeling I get when skiing Bogus is the same feeling I got with Targhee. I enjoy ""ma and pop"" hills and although Bogus is far larger than a ""ma and pop"" hill it still feels small. I love it. There are some slow oldie but goody lifts while there are high speed quads. There are short runs and then there are longer runs. I am slow and I enjoy my turns so all my runs are long. :) I win!\n\nBogus has an older foundation. Meaning it isn\'t all glitzed out like that of other ski resorts. Their locker rooms and bathrooms are older, their snack bar and bar are not fancy but they are perfect and rustic.\n\nWe stopped at the upper lodge for a burger and beers and I was surprised that we could actually afford to eat. A burger was $6.50. Most resorts now are overpriced and it costs about the same amount to eat as it does for a lift ticket. Way to go Bogus, trying to keep it affordable.\n\nOverall, I am excited to experience more of my town hill under the shiny sun. My first impression was off the charts positive. We are so lucky to have a place to take some turn. I went to Jackson\'s for three Aquafina waters and received $10.00 off each of our lift tickets. Great deal! Snow was great!\n\nThe lifts had music pumping and I thoroughly enjoyed the energy that was flowing through the loud speakers!', ""The proximity of Bogus Basin to Boise is fantastic and the facilities are great. It's unfortunate that their business practices are, well frankly - bogus. I reserved the yurt to spend an evening watching a meteor shower with friends. I received a confirmation email that the transaction was approved and they charged my credit card $125 for the transaction. In the email - they said I would receive a separate email with a code that would allow me to open the door to the yurt. I replied and asked them to please send it as I was concerned about cell phone coverage. No reply. I never received any email from them at all. That day I went up - figuring someone at the lodge would know how to get in. There was no one at the lodge - just a phone that went to an answering machine. I left a message and was never called back. We started driving around and found a house that looked like it belonged to the caretaker - so I went up and rang the doorbell. I knew somebody was there as Ted Nugent was blaring on the stereo and I could heard loud voices inside. After 10 minutes of ringing, knocking, and shouting I finally got the attention of the caretaker. He was a nice enough dude who tried to help us out. But - he didn't even know they had a yurt and had no idea how to get in! We went up t the office and he started trying to call the Bogus Basin people to find out about the yurt while some other friends started driving around trying to find any maintenance people who knew about the yurt. They finally found one - long before the caretaker was able to do anything and were given a code. It didn't work. We then found out about the 'secret' hiding location of the key and after nearly 3 hours of trying were able to get into the yurt. Again - the yurt is nice and we had a great evening watching the stars. I sent Bogus an email about the incident and asked them to respond so that I knew they had received it. It's been a week - no reply. There are way to many recreation opportunities in Idaho to have this kind of disregard for your customers. My recommendation is to take advantage of any of them - except for this one.""]",0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

There were only a dozen or so patrons inside, and I sat at the bar to examine the posted beer list.

Ingredients are always fresh and pizzas are consistently good.  Is there better pizza out there?  Yes, but for a chain that delivers?  This place takes the cake.', 'This week on Pizza Ken and Pizza Tom review pizza:\n\nEXTREME PIZZA\n\nThat\'s not just a declaration, that\'s the apparent name of the store. EXTREME!!!\n\nHow extreme was it?\n\nI personally knew nothing about Extreme Pizza before going in on Monday to try them out. Having looked them up a bit before writing this review, I\'ve since discovered that they\'re a coast-to-coast franchise that focuses on having novelty designs for their specialties.\n\nTheir atmosphere is extremely basic. An effectively forgettable half-hipster half-sporster kind of feel. I mean, a Ms. Pacman arcade sat tall underneath a small widescreen showing the latest game. To be honest, I was unsure what sort of crowd that\'s aiming to appeal to. But it makes me want to say a ""stout-drinking"" hipster would be more at home here than an ""IPA-drinking"" hipster. Don\'t take that last part to heart, though.\n\nOur pizza had already been ordered by our friend Nathan who joined us for this week. Thanks Nate! To be honest I completely forget the name of the special, but I can remember that they had a lot of interesting and quirky names on their menu. So if you\'re someone who likes to make guesses at what toppings are included on pizzas named ""WHAM, BAM, THANK YOU MAMMOTH"" and such, you\'ve come to the right place.\n\nSitting at the table, it seemed a little dingy. The table itself had that kind of plastic top that seems to create a thin coat of black goo over time. I am pretty sure the table was clean, but it was obviously pretty cheap. I didn\'t worry about it, but, it stuck out to me.\n\nThe pizza took about 15 - 20 minutes to arrive after Nate had ordered. Not bad. Definitely faster than some other places we\'ve been in the last few weeks. The price on the pizz itself was $24, and I paid about $2 for my drink, so three drinks would have been $30.\n\nWell, let\'s dig in:\n\nThe first thing I noticed about the pizza was that it was a Chicago-ish style. The cheese seemed to be spread on top of the toppings. Unlike other Chicago pizza, though, it didn\'t ring particularly thick or anything. It\'s unclear what sort of region this style is supposed to hail from, but it\'s hardly important.\n\n-Pepperoni-\nThe easiest thing to notice was that there weren\'t many pepps. Perhaps it was because they were hidden in the cheese, but Nate actually tried to hunt through a slice and count them and he felt a bit disappointed. There wasn\'t much of a pepp flavor that stood out past the cheese. I don\'t mean to sound so negative, because actually the cheese and the sauce and the crust all came together very, very well. I could have used a few more pepps is all.\n\n-Specialty-\nThis was a barbecue chicken special, recommended to Nate by the restaurant staff. BBQ sauce rather than classic red, chicken cubes were well cooked and flavorful, and onions and cilantro thrown on top. I am actually one of those people who can\'t stand cilantro, but, they kept it at a good ratio on the slices, and I was able to enjoy it.\n\nThe whole pizza in general had a well-baked crust, the cheeses were gooey and stretchy without overwhelming the rest of the toppings. On both, the sauce complimented and gave the slices a solid completeness.\n\n-Verdict-\nOriginally, while in the store, I was inclined to give Extreme Pizza perhaps a 3 out of 5. Perhaps it was because I didn\'t feel the pizza lived up to the title of ""extreme."" The atmosphere of the place also left something to be desired, if you ask me. However, I will say that the pizza came together really well. And looking back at that long list of weird specialties, I know for a fact that I\'d like to revisit and try out a few different slices.\n\nIt might not quite live up to its name, but I guess ""Above Average Pizza"" doesn\'t roll off the tongue quite as well as E X T R E M E!!!\n\n4 extreme slices out of 5']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0

Pride of ownership and care for customers and community shine here.\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD GO:  Great food in generous portions at good prices is a key reason to go to Neighbor Tim\'s.  But you might also go to support Tim because he is of the vanishing breed of ""let\'s do what\'s right for employees, customers and community"" business owners with a young family that include his charming wife and three adorable kids all under the age of six (I think) who took a chance on Boise by relocating his long time (since 2004) BBQ and catering biz from Santa Barbara to here to open in June 2021.  The over 100 reviews with 5 star average include happy customers in Santa Barbara days.  \n\nMEET TIM:  Tim\'s delightful, downhome prose on webpage and FB page that first led us to the drive up window.\n\nAs this:  ""We are a genuine Texas style BBQ team made up of a farm-boy husband and surfer-girl wife...bringing the best smoked meat product there is...to serve our guests with as much genuineness and respect as our neighbors deserve...Having been born and raised on a three generation cattle and wheat farm in South Dakota growing up, my mom and dad taught us kids to love your neighbor and to love your enemy even more.

Appreciation for the food that keeps my hubby and me coming back.\n\nTHE FOOD:  If you read my Yelp friend Juli S.\'s (6/26/21) you will have lots of good information about the eats.  I could not write it better than does she.  I will just offer brisket burnt ends are available on Wednesdays and Tim has just started offering smoked turkey breast, sliced on sandwiches and by pound, on Thursdays (go order so he\'ll keep this on the menu). The dee-licious German sausages (pork) on are made for him by a German specialty butcher in Nampa.  Sandwich buns come from local baker Gaston\'s.  Beef brisket is from a young ""mom n pop"" owned Idaho cattle ranch.  Pork is commodity sourced, as is so for almost all BBQ places as most consumers will not pay substantially higher price needed to source pastured pork.  Menu includes ribs, brisket, pulled pork, sausages and handcrafted (as example, no slaw out of a bag here, it starts with fresh veg) sides with prices starting at $3.50.  Menu here: https://www.neighbortimsbbq.com/menu-1\n\nTHE SERVICE:  The people at the take away windows on our visits have been young, this may be the first \'customer facing\' job for some, and so friendly and efficient.  Good for them and for Tim for the training of them.  The food is expertly packed to go as well.  Order when you drive up or you can call ahead.  We did that once but not sure it matters for a small order as in for a couple or small family as you still wait in car line to pick it up. But if placing a large order be a good neighbor and call ahead.  It saves you and the people behind you in car line time and it helps Tim\'s crew out too.\n\nTIPS:\n*Ask for cold sides, like potato salad or slaw, to be bagged separately so they don\'t get hot tucked in with the hot box on the drive home.\n\n*Special menu available to students at Capitol High across the street at lunch hour with low prices to fit into their lunch budgets.  A neighborly idea!  But heads up, you may want to avoid the peak of high school lunch hour and go for your order just before or after.\n\n*Catering!  A number of 5 star reviews behind the Yelp filter sing the praises of Neighbor Tim\'s catering for events ranging from wedding receptions to birthday parties to business meetings to boat shows.\n\nEQUAL ACCESS:  The seating set ups do not meet the requirements of ADA rules so a child in wheelchair or a parent using walker would not be able to have a seat at table to stay and eat.  Just as I can\'t (I have MS). Easy fixes. I hope Tim will make them.  \n\nLOO: None.  Plan accordingly.\n\nPARKING:  On site.', ""Congrats Santa Barbara\n\nYou finally have somewhere to go, for what the rest of the world considers to be barbecue.  Nothing against Santa Maria style grilling, but comparing tri-tip to brisket is like comparing hamburger to filet minion.\n\nI was lucky enough to try his Que on the second day of having a Santa Barbara legal trailer.

Noise is deafening given too loud music, tight tables and high ceilings. \n\nMENU:  Laminated menu has food on one side and libations on the other.\xa0 (Wine list separately.)\xa0 Casual fare.\xa0 Divided into salads ($9-13), starters ($9-13), veggies ($7-8), pizzas ($14-18 @ 14"") and \'plate of the day\' ($17 - $30).\xa0 It works for individual meals (as most around us seemed to order) or for grazeable sharing (our preference).\n\nEATS:  Pizzas are intended stars with about a dozen options in red or white and topped with best quality ingredients in both traditional and unique combos.\xa0 Cut into 8 pieces, they are easy to share even 4 ways.\xa0 Anyone who loves pizza knows the dough is ""the thing"" and it is a good thing here for chew although crust edges are too thick, puffy and white to be my thing.\xa0 Different strokes.\n\nVALUE:  Meal for two - $60ish before tax and tip included 2 specialty  cocktails ($20) + 1 veg plate ($8) + 1 pizza ($18) + 1 dessert ($9) + 1 cup coffee specialty ($6.50).\xa0\n\nLIBATONS:  House cocktails well priced (@$10) for quality ingredients and skilled mixology.\xa0 Wine list by bottle ranges @ $40-$125. By glass options @$9 - $13  (UPDATE 11/18:  House wine $5/glass 11:00 - 4:00.) Coffee from local company Form and Function (Update 11/18: now next door neighbor here).\n\nSERVICE:  Alyx did a top notch job.\xa0 Clearly experienced in the craft of restaurant service, she knew the menu well to answer questions and recommend options, her demeanor was pitch perfect blend of friendly without being familiar and while clearly working her legs off all night with full house, we always felt well tended. \xa0That she enjoys working there shows. Good service can make all the difference for diners\' patience and so it did here as Alyx set our expectations up-front for ""family style"" service model and associated food delays that evening.\n\n""FAMILY STYLE"" KITCHEN TO TABLE SERVICE IS  ""NO-GO"" IMHO:  ""family style"" here means the kitchen sends dishes out as they are completed not necessarily for serving all diners at table at same time. Examples: At table of 6 behind us, the veg dish ordered as main by one diner arrived 10 minutes before salads as main ordered by 2 others, then much longer delay before still another diner got his entrée and even more long delay before pizzas were delivered remaining 2 diners.  For couple next to us, her salad arrived nearly 20 minutes before his pizza; salad which sat to warm and wilt while waiting.\xa0 Not good for diners.  Ultimately, it won\'t work for the house either because tables held up by this kitchen output can\'t be turned to seat waiting others.\n\nACCESSIBILITY:  Level in from sidewalk both entrances.\xa0 All one floor.\xa0 Aisle-ways too tight for wheelchair users to get to many of the tables.  Loos are accessible.  \n\nPARKING:  Very limited on street made worse by construction.  Gravel lot across is permit-only \'til 6p then $5.  (UPDATE 11/18:  ADA parking finally added to lot on corner and on street across from restaurant. Delay wasn\'t restaurant\'s issue but city\'s.)\n\nLOCATION:  First floor of in-progress mixed-use (with apartments up) building  just a few blocks from hotels (Inn at 500 and Residence Inn) in old residential area being canniblized for commercial construction.\n\nTHIS N THAT: \n1) HAPPY HOUR:  Not now.\n2) LA LOVELY LOO:  Spacious and gender neutral.  Expensive finishes like Duravit sinks, brushed brass fixtures and obscure glass front doors thru which you see shapes passing in the hall as you...ummm...perch.  Can they see you? :-)', ""They deserve 4 1/2 stars... cocktails here are epic! If you want to not be disappointed, order the True Grit- it's literally the best drink I've ever had. Only downside is that they stay busy, and there's no happy hour. We ordered the Wylder Chopped salad, which is one of my new favs- salami, provolone, Crispy chickpeas and vinaigrette- easily shareable for 2 people. Summer squash noodles was good, but it's healthy, so be wanting healthy when you order. Then we had the honey badger pizza $18- it's amazing!!! Savory and sweet in one pizza. They know what they're doing. My one regret was not trying their pina colada drink.. sounds and looks amazing!""]",0.6,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.0,1.0,30.0

Beats the ""figgy pudding"" of the Christmas song all to heck!  Or take the Vanilla Cream Cheese option home to pour some port (Telaya\'s new port release as example) over it.  All will be merry and bright!\n\nBut as good as this ice cream is (they use Idaho based Reed\'s dairy mix as their base so it starts from good foundation), I don\'t make the journey to the BoDo location given the parking is simply woeful.  And if you think regular parking in the area is lousy, try being a person with Multiple Sclerosis who relies on the city of Boise to have adequate (per now 27 year old ADA law) accessible parking (ha...ha...not) and you\'ll see an even bigger barrier to getting from car to the door.\n\nBottom line is this is good stuff ice cream and the product is so rich and flavor filled that even a small cup serving hits the spot.  I think they may have had Salt & Straw in Portland as a concept when starting this business, but having enjoyed Salt & Straw delights several times, I\'d say the STIL options are perhaps even better, more approachable for all palates.  Think as in Eugene\'s Red Wagon.\n\nAnd yes, that I know all these places products so well suggests I have an ice cream addiction.  Now if I could just park and get out of my car to get in here, STIL would join my list of those preferred providers who feed the addiction.', ""Today, Indigo and I were on the town for the day. It was boutique day and we had already been to few fancy places when we remembered it was free micro scoop day for kids at the STIL. \n\nThe STIL is what can only be described as fancy, boutique ice cream in a perfect spot for people watching. \n\nIndigo got a micro scoop of vanilla cream cheese ice cream, which reminded me of Haagen Dazs only creamier, which was fantastic! \n\nI got a micro scoop of the coconut matcha ice cream which has a coconut base. They also have another matcha flavor which has a milk base. I'm coconut and matcha crazy so this was the flavor for me! It was not too sweet, earthy from the matcha (which I believe is from Wanna Matcha) and toasty from the coconut. \n\nService was friendly, they are always kind to Indigo which I appreciate, and fast. We ate our treats on the patio and enjoyed the sunny day. \n\nNext door, we saw the kind gentleman from Idaho Trust Bank (who earlier gave Indigo a blue piggy bank) and stopped to say goodbye on the way back to the car. She showed off her piggy (she's pig crazy) for a moment and off we went. \n\nIt was a sweet way to end our boutique day downtown. \n\nIf you're feeling fancy, give the STIL a try! \n\nIndigo gives the STIL 30 stars for decadent ice cream and a pig friendly patio."", 'So I\'ve reviewed this place before, but I wanted to provide an update as these guys are really killing it.  I gave them 4 stars before, but completely deleted the old review (didn\'t simply ""update review"") because this place really deserves a full 5 stars, and my previous review no longer applied.\n\nI came here on a Saturday night over Labor Day Weekend.  I\'m usually impressed that this ice cream store seems to always have a line out the door, and of course a busy Saturday night was no different.  As an industrial engineer, I\'m always curious to see how fast lines move and see how businesses try to efficiently move customers through the door.  So we decided to time our wait in line.  From the time we got in line (we joined the line just slightly outside of the gated patio area) to the time we paid, it took a bit over 17 minutes-- but don\'t let that detract you from visiting this fun place!  Some members of our group played corn hole on the patio while others held our spot in line.  It\'s a fun atmosphere & the wait doesn\'t really seem too daunting knowing you have such a tasty treat to look forward to.\n\nOnce you get up to the counter, I can see why the line takes a bit of time to get moving.  The employees are SUPER friendly & you don\'t feel rushed at all.  They let you sample anything you want & are extremely patient while you pick out the flavors, cups, cones, sizes, etc.  This is fabulous!  While it does make the line move more slowly, the customer service and genuine friendliness of the employees make you really feel like a valued customer.  The employees all seemed happy to be there and happy to help us pick out a flavor that we\'d enjoy most. \n\nThe ice cream itself is actually phenomenal.  I\'m absolutely obsessed with ""artisan"" ice cream & have visited the shops of most of the big-name players in this space.  The STIL\'s ice cream is honestly right up there with the likes of Salt & Straw (Portland), Ample Hills (NYC), & Van Leeuwen (NYC).  The flavors are really unique to Boise and of course they have their booze-infused flavors.  (Side note: make sure you bring your ID if you want to order these!  I came a week prior without mine & wasn\'t allowed to order the booze flavors!)  I\'ve been here a few times & my favorite flavors are the ""Idaho Wilderness"" (lavender & berries), ""Ed & Carl take Reno"" (honey bourbon), & ""The Mad Hatter"" (pistachio & mint).  The ice cream is extremely creamy and thick, almost like a custard, but doesn\'t leave a greasy film in your mouth like some other premium ice creams.  The flavors that have mix-ins are not overly heavy on the mix-ins-- which I love as I hate when there\'s more chunks than ice cream.  The ice cream sandwiches look particularly soft and delicious so I\'m planning to order that next time I\'m in!\n\nAs portions go, The STIL gives you a TON of ice cream for the price you pay.  I usually get the single scoop, but this time that I went I got a double, and I think I got over a pint of ice cream.  They really load up the cup & it was just a little over $5.  When the guy scooping it handed me my cup, I was amazed that the double came with so much.  Of course I ate it all though because I would never dare to throw away ice cream :)\n\nOverall, a quality place to spend your evening with an ever higher quality ice cream to match it.  I know many places in Boise are overly hyped and whenever you see a line somewhere it\'s often because people are disillusioned by the atmosphere.  The STIL is different.  The ice cream actually lives up to the hype, and indeed is worth standing 17 minutes in line for.  Can\'t wait to go back soon!']",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0

I attribute it to a previously unknown category known as ""Clutch Factor"".  I was at the Egyptian attending an event and had already purchased the one theater beer I said I\'d get. It was fairly expensive and wasn\'t even a beer I was particularly fond of, but I just got it  to show my support for the venue and presenters. By the time intermission came, my theater:beer ratio was already tragically skewed. I decided to step outside and get some fresh air when I noticed Taphouse. I managed to stroll next door and get an 11.25% glass of deliciousness and a JD sidecar for a price much more favorable that the theater beer. In matter of minutes, I returned to the theater in much better spirits having restored order to my theater:beer ratio. Heck, the intermission was so long that I didn\'t even miss anything! Lucky me. Anyway, the Taphouse has great brews, wine, meals and snacks, and the prices are totally reasonable. The Taphouse has your back.', ""Let me start off by saying that this was set to be a solid 4 star review. Went for a place to sit outdoors but when we got there the outdoor seating was full. Sat inside for a but and service was prompt. Soon a table opened and we moved outside. It was ridiculously noisy inside due to being a Friday night and games being on. Once outside though, the ambiance was nice and the same waitress stayed with us. There is a decent beer selection, a few strange cocktails and an okay selection of bar food.... burgers, wing, sandwiches.... and what??? Prime rib :) \n\nOur table ordered a variety, and everything was super tasty. The burgers are hearty and a good size, 12 boneless wings are huge, prime rib is a sizable cut but a little undercooked (the au ju is too peppery) and the turkey sandwich plate was stellar. At the end though a waiter came out and was down right mean, accusing us of being told not to smoke and continuing to do so. He was menacing and accusatory, then have a half hearted apology when we told him no one had said anything and that we had not all been smoking. The fact is, I was putting mine out and we were in a corner away from people. Before we moved, I'd told the waitress there were smokers. I didn't even know you can't smoke outside in Boise, my bad. I had something similar but not as bad at solid about smoking so perhaps its s city rule. However, beyond that the guy was MEAN he all but yelled at us. His voice was raised, other patrons looked our way, and he accused us as though we had intentionally broke the rules.  There was no need for the aggression and my night, after spending 60.00 was wasted. I don't have money for that! Its not often I can go out and he ruined my night. I tried to call later to speak to a manager and it was so loud that he couldn't hear me, or so he said. . .

There were many things to like here,  Were I of the neighborhood I might make this a regular stop.  In fact on the day of my hubby\'s and my late lunch visit to Cloud 9 it seemed as if the fifteen or so folks who were present when we arrived and the dozen or so still present when we left who ranged in age from toddlers to septuagenarians seemed to be neighborhood folks.  We can see why this could be a convenient and welcoming gathering place for them.  But it would not necessarily be a destination place for us again.  \n\nHere\'s why:\n\n*Although the food was a good value (lunch for two plus two root beers was only about $21) and good enough in flavor it was not so good as to make us want to go back for food alone.  As example, some of the salad greens had seen fresher days but the salad dressing was delicious.  The sweet potato soup was good but not better than I can do at home. \n\n*We don\'t drink beer, so that wouldn\'t be our destination draw here and while their house brewed root beer was interesting enough, it was not so interesting that we\'d  have it again.  It was also served too warm, nearly room temperature.\n\n*While the servers, two on duty and one tended bar as well, were friendly the service ws so inefficient that even with arrival just before 2:00 and few orders coming out of the kitchen, it seemed folks there were mostly enjoying libations, it took well over an hour for lunch.  Much of  the time spent waiting to have our order taken and then waiting on the soup and salad and simple sandwich to come out of the kitchen.\n\nSo while we\'re unlikely to return ourselves as destination and not sure we\'d recommend it to others as  destination, we would recommend this as convenience if you\'re in the neighborhood anyway.\n\nTHIS  N THAT\n\n1) PARKING:  Ample amount in strip mall lot.\n\n2) ACCESSIBILITY:  Level in and all on one floor.

The patio was inviting and the seating was better than normal patio seating so we decided on that because of the beautiful weather. Our server was very knowledgeable of the different beers and food specials. I started out with the Salted Caramel Stout, and the wife had their malbec, which were both great. The Salted Caramel tasted like a Guinness with a fresh twist and wasn't quite as heavy. I had the classic burger and she had the Apple Pecan Salad. The food came out quick and was skillfully made. The meat and veggies were all very fresh and flavorful without having to drown it in ranch or mayo. The second beer I had was the Never Say Never IPA, which was the highlight of the evening. Very tasty for an IPA but not as hoppy as I expected. It was an beer I'd give to someone just starting out on IPAs. Went down smooth, light and refreshing. Perfect for a July evening. As an added bonus, they accidentally poured an extra one and gave it to us! So I was feeling it when I left. The wife finished with the chocolate mousse dessert which was tasty but unmemorable. The one knock I would give it would be the location, as it's right next to an Anytime Fitness and you can see people on the treadmills. \n\nI'm excited to go again, and since it's walking distance from my house I feel like I'll be there a lot!"", ""Cloud 9 is an awesome name.\n\nAnd, if you order their Bleu Cheese Fries, it's not only an awesome name, it's apt.\n\nCame here on a Thursday night for a UYE I organized where 8-10 people were expected.

The two servers who were working were so completely lovely and accommodating--as the place began to fill and I'm by myself hoarding a table for 8.  Seriously.  I realize in a place this small, my table saving wasn't terribly convenient and so I really appreciated their understanding.\n\nSo, having said that--I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place if you've a large group.  They've only just recently opened and word has spread quickly, as they are standing room only on most Thurs, Fri, and Sat nights.  But, my people, great energy abounds in this place.  It's a true neighborhood joint hidden in the back of the strip mall by the original Albertson's.  And, though I'm not a beer drinker, my main dining companion is a big fan of their salted caramel stout.    \n\nTheir food menu isn't expansive but what is there is quality and farm to table fresh.
